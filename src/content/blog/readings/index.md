[Source](https://kill-the-newsletter.com/feeds/ds7kuqx2r8383zq9o3d1/entries/tewibm5dazhsxtcxp5qj.html)

This is a weekly digest from Semantic Scholar for the week of September 22-28, presenting papers from a user's "Influential Papers" feed. It highlights three papers: one proposing a criterion for machine consciousness, another exploring the role of language in human-like intelligence, and a third discussing the emergence of human consciousness in relation to language evolution. The digest includes options to save papers, mark them as irrelevant, and view more papers, along with information about TLDR summaries and links to Semantic Scholar's social media and newsletter.
