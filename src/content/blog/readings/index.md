This is a weekly newsletter based on my RSS feeds. I have an LLM pipeline select the most relevant articles from my feeds (based on the about page of this website) and summarize them. 


## Environmental context scaffolds children's semantic representation of novel words

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725001027?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This is a ScienceDirect page displaying a research article titled "Environmental context scaffolds children's semantic representation of novel words."  The study investigates how environmental context (kitchen vs. outdoors) influences preschoolers' understanding of new words.  Results suggest that children utilize contextual information to build richer semantic representations, demonstrating this by predicting word usage based on context-related verbs.  The data and analysis are publicly available.

## Loopholes: A window into value alignment and the communication of meaning

This is a ScienceDirect page displaying a full-length article titled "Loopholes: A window into value alignment and the communication of meaning."  The article explores intentional misunderstandings (loopholes) in communication, using a combination of theoretical analysis and empirical studies (three studies examining loophole frequency, evaluation, and prediction in various social contexts).  The research suggests loopholes are distinct from compliance and non-compliance, frequently used in unequal power dynamics, and offer insights into cooperation and communication, with implications for human-machine interaction.

## Observed reaching speed signals stimulus value and informs foraging

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725000885?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This ScienceDirect article investigates whether observed reaching speed signals stimulus value and influences foraging behavior.  Four experiments using a novel "tree-shaker" task demonstrated that: 1)  Reaching speed correlates with stimulus value (replicating prior research); 2) Observers accurately infer stimulus value from observed reaching speed; 3) Observed reaching speed influences observers' desire to forage the stimulus; and 4) Observed reaching speed affects observers' foraging time and effort, with faster reaching leading to greater investment.  The findings highlight the role of action understanding and perception-action coupling in social learning and optimal foraging decisions.

## The specificity of sequential statistical learning: Statistical learning accumulates predictive information from unstructured input but is dissociable from (declarative) memory for words

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725000708?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This is a ScienceDirect article from the journal *Cognition* investigating the role of statistical learning in word segmentation.  Through computational modeling and two experiments, the authors argue that while statistical learning allows learners to track sequential dependencies (predictive processing), it's dissociable from declarative memory for words.  Learners primarily utilize statistical learning in continuous speech, not pre-segmented sequences, and rarely form memorable representations of words from continuous streams, even when demonstrating sensitivity to transitional probabilities.  The study challenges memory-based theories of statistical learning.

## Common and distinct neural substrates of rule- and similarity-based category learning

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725000836?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This is a ScienceDirect article preview detailing a study on the neural substrates of rule-based and similarity-based category learning.  Using EEG-fNIRS, three experiments investigated whether distinct or shared neural mechanisms underpin these strategies. Results suggest distinct neural processes: rule-based learning involves hypothesis testing and semantic processing (larger P300, N400, Wernicke's area activation), while similarity-based learning relies on complex visual processing and feature integration (larger P1, frontopolar cortex activation).  These findings support a multiple-system (COVIS) model over single-system accounts of category learning.  Data and analysis scripts are available on OSF.

## Semantic extension in a novel communication system is facilitated by salient shared associations

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725000691?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This paper reports two experiments investigating semantic extension in novel communication systems.  Participants, working in pairs, used geometric shapes to label images of shapes, colors, objects, and emotions. Experiment 1 showed that consistent shape-color pairings facilitated initial semantic extension and subsequent chaining of extensions to objects and emotions, although less certain associations (e.g., color-emotion) led to more variable extensions.  Experiment 2, with a between-subjects design and shape remapping, confirmed these findings, highlighting the importance of shared associations in successful semantic extension.  Unexpectedly, both experiments revealed participants' reliance on pre-existing non-arbitrary associations between shapes, colors, and emotions, even when experimentally manipulated. The results support the hypothesis that shared common ground facilitates creative semantic extension, with metonymic extensions proving more frequent than metaphorical ones.  The study proposes a flexible experimental paradigm for further research into semantic extension and its implications for language evolution and change.

## 'Influential Papers' Feed - 5 New Papers

[Source](https://kill-the-newsletter.com/feeds/ds7kuqx2r8383zq9o3d1/entries/3fwztzpu5qbx2lqk6dd0.html)

This is a Semantic Scholar weekly digest (April 28 - May 4) featuring five research papers on AI consciousness:  one reviews different types of AI awareness; another proposes a novel hypothesis on the evolution of human consciousness; a third introduces a dual-channel AI architecture; a fourth presents a categorical model of general consciousness; and the final one describes a model bridging the cognition gap between humans and ChatGPT.  Each paper includes a brief TLDR summary and options to save or dismiss the paper.
