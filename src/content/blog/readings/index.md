## Communicative pressures shape language during communication (not learning): Evidence from case-marking in artificial languages

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725001040?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This ScienceDirect article, published in Cognition journal, investigates whether communicative pressures shape language use during communication, as opposed to during learning. It presents an artificial language learning experiment focused on Differential Case Marking (DCM). The study found no evidence that learners develop a bias for communicatively efficient DCM during learning. However, when participants used the artificial language in a communicative task, they rapidly adopted DCM, suggesting that language adapts to communicative efficiency constraints during communication itself, not just during learning.

## Investigating retrieval strategies in an associative recognition test in working memory: Evidence from eye movements

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725001398?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This article investigates retrieval strategies in associative recognition within working memory using eye movements (LAN effect). Five experiments presented participants with word pairs and tested their recognition, tracking eye movements. The results consistently show that participants primarily use the first probe word to retrieve its associated pair, rather than using both words jointly. The study also explores factors affecting the onset of the LAN effect, finding that the timing of the task (inter-word interval) and the layout of the display influence when LAN begins. It suggests that the location information is still incidentally bound to the content in WM, and is automatically retrieved at test, even though the location is never explicitly tested.

## 'Influential Papers' Feed - 1 New Paper

[Source](https://kill-the-newsletter.com/feeds/ds7kuqx2r8383zq9o3d1/entries/i0zcpsapktypoeyo61dr.html)

This is a weekly digest from Semantic Scholar, highlighting a paper from the user's "Influential Papers" feed. The featured paper, "The Unified Cognitive Consciousness Theory for Language Models," proposes that LLMs are unconscious substrates of linguistic and conceptual patterns, rather than deficient agents. The email provides options to save the paper, mark it as not relevant, view more papers, and manage email alerts. It also includes links to Semantic Scholar's social media, newsletter sign-up, and contact information.

## The interoceptive origin of reinforcement learning

[Source](https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(25)00120-2?rss=yes)

Traditional reinforcement learning focuses on how rewards shape behavior. This perspective argues that primary rewards, like food, originate internally and subliminally during digestion. This redefines rewards as state-dependent evaluations of actions' impact on physiological processes, necessitating a revised reinforcement learning framework.

## Diffindo! Precise language comprehension in older adulthood revealed by event-related brain potential studies of domain knowledge

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725001507?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This ScienceDirect article, "Diffindo! Precise language comprehension in older adulthood revealed by event-related brain potential studies of domain knowledge," investigates how older adults use their knowledge, particularly of the Harry Potter universe, to comprehend language in real-time. Using event-related potentials (ERPs), the study examines how domain knowledge influences semantic access and processing strategies in older adults compared to what is known about younger adults. The research explores whether greater domain knowledge leads to broader or more focused semantic activation during sentence comprehension in older adults, and how this relates to memory and stimulus evaluation.

## Modelling child learning and parsing of long-range syntactic dependencies

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725001209?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This is a preview of a ScienceDirect article titled "Modelling child learning and parsing of long-range syntactic dependencies" from the journal Cognition. The article presents a computational model of child language acquisition that learns syntax and semantics by training on child-directed speech paired with logical forms. The model uses Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) and an incremental expectation-maximization algorithm. The authors claim their model advances previous work by handling a wider range of syntactic constructions, including long-range dependencies like object wh-questions, and achieving higher accuracy in parsing and meaning inference.
