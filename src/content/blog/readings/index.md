This is a weekly newsletter based on my RSS feeds. I have an LLM pipeline select the most relevant articles from my feeds (based on the about page of this website) and summarize them. 


## Curiosity overpowers cognitive effort avoidance tendencies

This ScienceDirect article, titled "Curiosity overpowers cognitive effort avoidance tendencies," investigates whether curiosity motivates people to exert cognitive effort to acquire information, even when less effortful alternatives are available. Through three experiments using trivia questions and Random Dot Kinematograms (RDKs), the study found that participants were willing to invest cognitive effort (performing difficult RDK tasks) to satisfy their curiosity, but only when it was necessary to obtain the answer. When a low-effort option yielded the same information, participants avoided the high-effort task. The study concludes that curiosity can override cognitive effort avoidance, supporting theories of intrinsic reward and cost-benefit analysis in decision-making.

## Sensorimotor awareness requires intention: Evidence from minuscule eye movements

This ScienceDirect article from the journal *Cognition* investigates how intention and sensory consequences affect sensorimotor awareness, specifically concerning minuscule eye movements called microsaccades. The study compares awareness of intended, unintended, and spontaneous microsaccades, finding that intention significantly enhances awareness, even for movements that typically go unnoticed. The presence of visual stimuli had a limited effect on awareness. The researchers decoupled eye movements and their visual consequences to reveal that movement intention is an important driver of sensorimotor awareness for minuscule eye movements.

## (Un)intentionality bias in action observation revisited

This ScienceDirect article investigates how people perceive intentionality in ambiguous actions, specifically finger movements controlled by a device. The study found that the perceived intentionality of an action is influenced by factors like the posture of the finger (bent vs. straight) and the time delay before the action begins. Interestingly, individuals with higher schizotypal traits showed a different pattern of intentionality attribution compared to those with lower scores. The authors suggest that intention attribution isn't an automatic process but a complex cognitive integration, and that visual cues and expectations play a significant role in shaping our perceptions of others' intentions.

## Could AI understand emotions better than we do?

A study from the University of Geneva and the University of Bern found that generative AIs, including ChatGPT, outperformed humans in emotional intelligence tests. The AIs were also able to rapidly generate new, reliable EI tests. This suggests AI has potential in fields like education, coaching, and conflict management, though expert supervision is recommended.

## BI 212 John Beggs: Why Brains Seek the Edge of Chaos

[Source](https://braininspired.co/podcast/212/)

This is a webpage for Brain Inspired, a podcast exploring neuroscience and related topics. The page highlights episode 212 featuring John Beggs discussing the "critical brain hypothesis" - the idea that brain activity operates at the edge of chaos for optimal computation. It provides links to listen, download, and share the episode, along with supporting materials such as a transcript, relevant papers, and resources. The page also promotes supporting the podcast through Patreon and features a partnership with The Transmitter, a neuroscience news publication.
