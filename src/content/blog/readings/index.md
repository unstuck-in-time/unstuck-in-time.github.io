## 'Influential Papers' Feed - 1 New Paper

[Source](https://kill-the-newsletter.com/feeds/ds7kuqx2r8383zq9o3d1/entries/3c52ony8bp4ob0jvtyai.html)

This is a weekly digest from Semantic Scholar, dated August 19-25, highlighting papers from a user's "Influential Papers" feed. It features a paper titled "How Causal Abstraction Underpins Computational Explanation," summarizing that causal abstraction provides a useful lens for understanding computational implementation. The email includes options to save the paper, mark it as not relevant, and view more papers. It also explains what "TLDR" means and provides links to Semantic Scholar's social media, newsletter sign-up, alert management, and unsubscribe options.

## Are metabolic costs needed to explain cognitive fatigue?

[Source](https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(25)00210-4?rss=yes)

Pessiglione et al.'s MetaMotiF framework proposes that cognitive fatigue arises from a combination of motivational and metabolic factors, explaining why sustained cognitive effort becomes increasingly difficult. It suggests cognitive exertion, like physical exercise, has real costs that contribute to the feeling of exhaustion.

## The integrated control of decision and movement vigor

[Source](https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(25)00185-8?rss=yes)

Decision-making and movement vigor are typically co-regulated, likely through signal-to-noise ratio modulation in sensorimotor areas. However, this coupling can be decoupled via inhibitory control involving frontal areas and the basal ganglia, allowing for flexible behavior optimization when co-regulation compromises utility.

## Awake reactivation is not a uniform process

[Source](https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(25)00207-4?rss=yes)

Wakeful memory reactivation is complex, involving both conscious and unconscious processes. Recognizing these different types of reactivation may resolve inconsistencies in research on memory consolidation during wakefulness.
