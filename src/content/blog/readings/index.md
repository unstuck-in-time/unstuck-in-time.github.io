## Sensorimotor mismatch but not rotational inertia contributes to the size-weight illusion and weight perception for handheld objects

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725001106?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This ScienceDirect article investigates whether rotational inertia influences weight perception and the size-weight illusion (SWI). Two experiments were conducted using handheld spheres. Experiment 1 manipulated the rotational inertia of spheres of equal size and weight, finding no impact on perceived weight. Experiment 2 examined the SWI with sets of spheres having varied mass distributions and therefore inertia, also finding no relationship between rotational inertia and the illusion's magnitude. The study found that lifting force correlated with perceived weight, suggesting sensorimotor mismatches contribute to the SWI. The research challenges the notion that rotational inertia is a key factor in weight perception and the SWI, suggesting its influence may be limited to specific contexts involving rod-based objects. The study concludes that more general, naturalistic lifting contexts should be used for future weight perception studies.

## Speech categorization consistency is associated with language and reading abilities in school-age children: Implications for language and reading disorders

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725001349?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This ScienceDirect article preview is for a study investigating the relationship between speech categorization consistency and language/reading abilities in school-age children, including those with disabilities. The study uses a visual analog scaling (VAS) task, a continuous measure of speech categorization, and aims to address limitations of traditional forced-choice tasks. The research explores how categorization consistency, gradiency, and amplitude relate to language and reading skills, while also considering the mediating effects of phonological processing and executive function. The study suggests that the consistency of perceptual processes, rather than the quality of the representations, is the critical property of speech perception associated with broader language and reading function.

## Agency, desire, and the conceptual representation of consent

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725001301?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This ScienceDirect article examines the conceptual representation of consent through a series of studies using linguistic analysis, experimental tasks, and natural language processing. The research suggests that consent is often associated with a "patient" role in interactions and indicates instrumental desire (desire as a means to an end) rather than intrinsic desire. The article concludes that this association may contribute to skepticism about consent's effectiveness in the sexual domain, where intrinsic desire is often expected, creating a mismatch between the concept of consent and prevailing moral norms.

## The role of attention and frames on third-party punishment and compensation choices

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725001325?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This ScienceDirect article, published in Cognition, investigates the impact of attention and information framing on third-party punishment and compensation choices in response to injustice. Through five experiments, the authors found that attention to the offender's payoff predicts punishment, while manipulating information frames (revealing either the offender's or victim's payoff) significantly influences decisions. They observed an "offender bias" where people tend to focus on the offender's outcomes, and that exposing individuals to information they wouldn't normally seek can shift their choices. While the role of empathy was not clear, the study suggests that bottom-up attentional mechanisms and information framing significantly shape moral decision-making, with implications for understanding information bubbles and promoting fairer outcomes.

## Gaze behavior in face-to-face interaction: A cross-cultural investigation between Japan and The Netherlands

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725001143?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This ScienceDirect article investigates cross-cultural differences in gaze behavior between Japanese and Dutch dyads during unstructured conversation and a collaborative Duplo model-copying task. The study examines gaze avoidance, gaze-gesture coupling, and gaze-action coupling. The findings suggest that Japanese participants consistently looked less at faces than Dutch participants. They also used fewer pointing gestures and kept their hands under the table more often. While visuomotor coordination was similar, extended gaze-action patterns diverged, potentially reflecting cultural strategies and error orientation styles. The study highlights the importance of assessing gaze behavior within the context of interaction and cultural differences.

## Children's reaction to unequal norm enforcement: The role of meta-norms in fairness judgments and emotion attributions

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725001374?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This ScienceDirect article preview summarizes research on children's understanding of fairness in punishment. Two studies examined how children aged 6-9 react to unequal punishment for the same transgression. The results indicate children expect consistent consequences based on a "meta-norm" of equal enforcement, and they attribute mixed emotions to both punished and unpunished individuals, suggesting punishment can offer emotional relief. The research contributes to understanding children's moral reasoning, fairness sensitivity, and emotional attributions.

## Reasoning and Argumentation

[Source](https://oecs.mit.edu/pub/wxnjre8g)

This is a summary of Hugo Mercier's article "Reasoning and Argumentation" published in the Open Encyclopedia of Cognitive Science. The article explores the relationship between individual reasoning and social argumentation, highlighting historical perspectives, core concepts like dual-process theory and the interactionist theory of reason, and current debates. These debates concern how individual reasoning relates to internalized argumentation, how well people reason together, the development of argumentation skills, and whether large language models can argue like humans. The article also touches upon broader connections to metarepresentational mechanisms and their social functions.

## The Extended Evolutionary Synthesis

[Source](https://oecs.mit.edu/pub/z7lx4w72)

This article from the Open Encyclopedia of Cognitive Science discusses the Extended Evolutionary Synthesis (EES), a 21st-century evolutionary theory. The EES emphasizes the role of developmental processes, including memory and learning, in heredity and evolution, challenging the traditional neo-Darwinian view. Core concepts include developmental plasticity, extended heredity (including epigenetic and cultural inheritance), organismal agency and niche construction, and extended selection mechanisms. It highlights the ongoing debates and controversies surrounding the EES and its broader implications for various fields, including philosophy and the social sciences.

## Shared Intentionality

[Source](https://oecs.mit.edu/pub/sep9e3c2)

Michael Tomasello's article "Shared Intentionality" for the Open Encyclopedia of Cognitive Science explores humans' unique ability to collaborate and function as a "we," distinguishing it from other species. It discusses the evolution and development of joint and collective agencies, highlighting core concepts like joint goals, common ground, roles, coordination, and commitments. The article addresses controversies regarding shared intentionality in other primates and argues for its central role in human cognition, bridging psychology with social sciences like anthropology.

## Play

[Source](https://oecs.mit.edu/pub/y4e45rq6)

This article from the Open Encyclopedia of Cognitive Science defines "play" as intrinsically motivated behavior, often costly, pursued for idiosyncratic ends. It explores the history of understanding play, from early reinforcement theories to current cognitive perspectives. It discusses different accounts of play, including evolutionary spandrel, a signal of fitness, social bonding, practice, and learning. The article further examines the challenges in explaining human play and its potential connection to cognition, as well as broader connections to robotics and AI.

## Neuroscience of Syntax

[Source](https://oecs.mit.edu/pub/7n23j8sg)

This article, "Neuroscience of Syntax" published in the Open Encyclopedia of Cognitive Science, discusses how the brain processes syntax, the system of rules governing sentence construction. It refutes the idea of a single "syntax center," arguing instead for a distributed network within the left-lateralized frontal and temporal lobes. Syntactic processing is integrated with other language functions and relies on both predictive and integrative computations. Notably, brain areas involved in linguistic syntax are distinct from those processing structure in other domains.

## Sentence Processing

[Source](https://oecs.mit.edu/pub/mn7mjhx9)

This article from the Open Encyclopedia of Cognitive Science defines sentence processing as the study of how humans understand sentences, focusing on real-time comprehension and the integration of linguistic knowledge with world knowledge. It traces the history of the field, highlighting key theories like the Garden Path Theory and constraint-based parsing, and discusses core concepts such as processing complexity, local ambiguity, incremental processing, dependency formation, and priming. The article concludes by addressing current questions and controversies, including the role of AI, the need for broader linguistic diversity in research, and connections to neuroscience and language acquisition.

<!doctype html> Mothman | Buddhism | Animal-Robot Research | Sacred Values | The Matthew Effect New on the MIT Press Reader... New on the MIT Press Reader | View this email in your browser When a robotic therapy cat designed to provide comfort for people with dementia ended up in Ericka Johnsons home during the pandemic, it was met not by elderly patients, but by half-curious neighborhood kids and a disinterested rabbit named Topsey. Naturally, Johnson started filming. The resulting TikTok videos soon became part of a broader inquiry into how pets engage with machines. This month on the MIT Press Reader, in an essay excerpted from the new volume " How That Robot Made Me Feel ," Johnson follows that line of curiosity into stranger territory : robot cockroaches infiltrating insect groups, robotic finches teaching live birds how to forage, and rats wired to respond to voice commands. Funny and thought-provoking, her essay explores what this research reveals about robotic intelligibility, cross-species communication, and the future we imagine when we ask a machine to care. (An open access edition of the volume is available for free download here .)

## The big five and beyond

[Source](https://manyminds.libsyn.com/the-big-five-and-beyond)

If you've heard anything about the study of human personality, you've probably heard about the big five. This is a framework that attempts to characterize human personality in terms of five broad factors or dimensionsneuroticism, extraversion, openness, conscientiousness, and agreeableness. The big five framework has been enormously influential, generating heaps and heaps of data, and study after study on the stability of personality, on the factors that shape our personalities, on how our personalities predict success and satisfaction. But is the big five really the best we can do? What does it miss? What does it mask? Where should the science of human personality go next? My guest today is Dr. Ren Mttus . Ren is Professor of Psychology at the University of Edinburgh, and a leading researcher in the scientific study of human personality. Hes also one of the hosts of the Personality Psychology Podcast . Here, Ren and I talk about the history and colossal success of the big five. We consider whether personality is ultimately rooted in our biologyand, if so, how. We dwell on each of the five factors and dig into the facets and nuances within them. These are, actually, technical terms in the field for the more granular aspects of personality that sit within each of these broad dimensions. We talk about personality change across the lifespan, and what factors seem to be driving it. We talk about personality and occupation, personality and birth order, personality and gender. Along the way, Ren and I touch on the Myers-Briggs; an alternative to the Big 5 known as the HEXACO model; the power of explicit questionnaires over experiments; the concept of "personality age"; the social investment theory; honesty, humility, humor, jealousy; life satisfaction; gene-environment correlations; and why evolutionary stories about personality seem to fail.
