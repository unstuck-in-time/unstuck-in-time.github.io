## The emotional architecture of the psychedelic brain

[Source](https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(25)00201-3?rss=yes)

This document is a research review article titled "The Emotional Architecture of the Psychedelic Brain". It explores how psychedelics affect emotional processing, mood, and empathy, particularly in the context of treating psychiatric disorders like depression. The review discusses the impact of psychedelics on both negative and positive emotions, as well as emotional empathy. It also covers the role of emotion regulation strategies, challenging experiences, and neuroplasticity in psychedelic therapy. The article highlights the need for more precise characterization of emotional states and attention to the temporal dynamics of psychedelic-induced effects to optimize therapeutic impact.

## The role of gender labels and gendered appearances in children's social inferences

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725002215?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This ScienceDirect article examines how children weigh gender labels (e.g., "boy" or "girl") versus gendered appearances (e.g., clothing) when making assumptions about a person's traits and behaviors. Two studies, one with 4-5 year olds and another with 7-12 year olds, found that children consider both cues, but appearances are more influential when reasoning about feminine attributes, about individuals labeled "boy", and when the reasoners themselves are boys. These findings suggest that children's gender-based reasoning reflects societal norms and expectations around gender.

## I want to know why this feels so familiar: Familiarity-detection during recall failure prompts curiosity and information seeking

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725002264?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This ScienceDirect article preview for a December 2025 issue of *Cognition* explores the relationship between familiarity-detection during recall failure and curiosity. The study investigates whether feeling like you "almost know" something, specifically triggered by familiarity without recall, increases curiosity and information-seeking behavior. The researchers hypothesize that increased cue familiarity will lead to higher curiosity ratings and a greater willingness to expend resources to discover the source of that familiarity, along with increased internal memory search effort. They use the recognition without cued recall (RWCR) method to manipulate cue familiarity and measure curiosity levels and commission errors. The study aims to determine if familiarity-detection can drive both external (information seeking) and internal (memory search) information-seeking behaviors.

## Spatial and social cognition jointly determine multimodal demonstrative reference: Experimental evidence from Turkish and Spanish

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001002772500229X?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This ScienceDirect article investigates how spatial and social factors jointly influence demonstrative reference (like "this" and "that") in Turkish and Spanish, focusing on the role of pointing. Through three experiments, the study confirms that demonstrative choice depends on both the referent's location and the listener's attention, with the Turkish medial demonstrative 'şu' often used with pointing to direct attention, while Spanish demonstratives encode directional information. The findings support a "weighted parameters" framework, where different factors (referent position, listener attention) have varying influence depending on the language.

## Cross-species acoustic codes for yes and no in human nonverbal vocalizations

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725002240?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This ScienceDirect article from the journal *Cognition* (January 2026) explores cross-species acoustic codes for "yes" and "no" in human nonverbal vocalizations. Researchers tested if dogs could interpret human vocalizations of the syllable "bü" to signal "yes" (do it) or "no" (don't do it) in relation to locations "here" (toward the speaker) or "there" (away from the speaker). The study found that dogs could decode these vocalizations effectively, and the acoustic parameters encoding "yes/no" and "here/there" were similar, potentially rooted in the semantic primes "approach/avoid me." The research suggests that universal acoustic codes in mammal vocalizations may extend beyond inner-state messages to general, context-independent meanings.

## The role of prior beliefs in causal illusions

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725002306?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This ScienceDirect article investigates the "causal illusion," where people perceive a causal relationship between unrelated events. The study, comprised of three experiments, reveals that participants often hold a positive prior belief in a causal relationship even before experiencing any related events. Experiments tested the strength of this prior belief, if it could be modified by pre-training with positive or negative contingencies, and the effect of high cue/outcome density. The findings suggest causal illusions may stem from a pre-existing bias that isn't fully corrected by experience, challenging existing models of causal learning. The researchers propose a Bayesian approach, where prior beliefs and the interpretation of evidence play a crucial role in maintaining these illusions.
