## The moral pull of women and children

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725002616?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This is a preview of a ScienceDirect article titled "The moral pull of 'women and children.'"  The study investigates whether highlighting "women and children" as victims increases moral outrage, and if so, why. The research found that this phrase does increase moral outrage, even more so than highlighting civilians, and that this effect is not solely attributable to children. The study suggests that the inclusion of "women" is also a significant factor, potentially linked to benevolent sexism and traditional gender views, but may be limited to gender-conforming women. The authors explored these ideas across six experiments and provide open access to their research materials and data.

## Negative polarity illusions are robust with both ever and any (when linear position is held constant)

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725002355?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This ScienceDirect article investigates negative polarity illusions (NPIs) with "ever" and "any." Previous research showed illusions with "ever" but not "any," potentially due to linear position differences. This study replicated the experiment with controlled positioning and a larger sample size and found comparable illusions for both NPIs, supporting existing theories that attribute the illusion to general processing mechanisms. The study concludes that "any" is not inherently immune to the illusion and confirms the importance of linear position in NPI processing.

## 'Influential Papers' Feed - 2 New Papers

[Source](https://kill-the-newsletter.com/feeds/ds7kuqx2r8383zq9o3d1/entries/hvf0y232uzjjjycg1xef.html)

This is a weekly Semantic Scholar digest (September 8-14) highlighting papers related to "Influential Papers." It features two papers: one proposing a dual-resolution framework for consciousness and AI, and another using thought experiments to probe for qualia in AI. The digest also includes options to save papers, mark them as irrelevant, view more papers, and links to Semantic Scholar's social media, newsletter, and alert management options. TLDR is defined as an AI-generated short summary of a paper.

This is a web page for the journal "Trends in Cognitive Sciences" published by Cell Press. It provides options to log in, register, or access content through institutional access. The page features an article titled "Can AI really help solve the loneliness epidemic?" which argues that AI interactions are unlikely to alleviate loneliness, suggesting societal action is required instead. The page also offers navigation to other journals, publishing information, news, events, and details about Cell Press. There is also information on cookie preferences.

## Ruth Millikan: Unicepts

[Source](https://philosophyofbrains.com/2025/09/15/ruth-millikan-unicepts.aspx)

The Brains Blog is a leading forum since 2005 for work in the philosophy and science of mind. It features articles, podcasts, a calendar of events, calls for papers, and symposia. A recent post discusses Ruth Millikan's theory of "unicepts," which proposes that much of what we traditionally think of as concepts are actually "unicepts". These are particular to individuals and collect information about their subject, unlike concepts which are universal. The post includes commentary on Millikan's work and her replies.

## The pupillometric production effect: Evidence for enhanced processing preceding, during, and following production

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725002677?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This ScienceDirect article explores the "production effect," the phenomenon where reading words aloud leads to better memory recall than silent reading. The study uses pupillometry (measuring pupil dilation) across four experiments to track attention and cognitive processes during reading. The key findings are:

1.  Reading aloud causes greater pupil dilation than silent reading, suggesting increased attention.
2.  This pupillometric production effect correlates with the behavioral production effect (better memory recall).
3.  Repeating a control word aloud (saying "check") does not improve memory, even though it also causes pupil dilation, indicating that attention must be directed towards the target word for a memory benefit.
4.  The study suggests that production forces attentional engagement, which is a crucial facilitator of distinctive encoding, ultimately improving memory.

## Why boys cry and don't cry: The Contextual-Statistical (ConStat) approach to the perceived validity of generics

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725002641?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This is a preview of an article titled "Why boys cry and don't cry: The Contextual-Statistical (ConStat) approach to the perceived validity of generics" published in the journal *Cognition*. The article introduces the ConStat framework, which explains how people judge the validity of generic statements by considering the context and applying intuitive statistical reasoning. The framework posits that people interpret generics normatively or descriptively, focusing on either the category or the feature, and then evaluate their truth based on perceived prevalence relative to alternative categories and contextual factors.

## Confronting the connectivity crisis in human M/EEG research

[Source](https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(25)00240-2?rss=yes)

M/EEG cognitive neuroscience struggles with inconsistent and non-replicable measures of brain connectivity. The field needs collaborative efforts to test and validate connectivity metrics with shared data and protocols to establish reliable methods for research and clinical applications.

## Ruth Millikan: The Origin of Declarative Thought
