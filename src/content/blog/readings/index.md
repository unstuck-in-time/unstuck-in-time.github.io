## 'Influential Papers' Feed - 4 New Papers

[Source](https://kill-the-newsletter.com/feeds/ds7kuqx2r8383zq9o3d1/entries/m8v7xllq8tvho9j309a6.html)

This is a weekly digest from Semantic Scholar showcasing new papers related to "Influential Papers." It highlights four papers: one on the meta-problem of consciousness and the importance of being understood, one questioning introspection in large language models, one arguing LLMs support a radical view of language's effect on thought, and one emphasizing the importance of human memory in the age of AI. The email also includes options to save papers, mark them as irrelevant, view more papers, sign up for the Semantic Scholar newsletter, and manage alert preferences.

## What will society think about AI consciousness? Lessons from the animal case

[Source](https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(25)00147-0?rss=yes)

This document is a scientific article titled "What will society think about AI consciousness? Lessons from the animal case," published in Trends in Cognitive Sciences. The article explores how societal attitudes towards AI consciousness might be shaped by parallels with attitudes towards animal consciousness, while also considering the key differences between AI and animals that could lead to divergent views. It advocates for interdisciplinary research to understand the possibility of AI consciousness, public attitudes towards it, and the ethical and political norms required to interact with potentially conscious AI systems. It emphasizes the need to start preparing now for the societal implications of AI consciousness. Also included are standard website elements such as login options, journal navigation, related articles, and Cell Press information.

## Constructing language: a framework for explaining acquisition

[Source](https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(25)00142-1?rss=yes)

This document is a research article about language acquisition. The article proposes a constructivist framework for understanding how children learn language, emphasizing structure-building mechanisms, multimodal input, active learning, and dynamic developmental change. It argues that this framework, incorporating these components, provides a valuable lens for developing unified explanations of language acquisition, and discusses how this framework differs from nativist and empiricist theories. The article also touches on computational models, including large language models, and their applicability to human language acquisition.

## Neurobiology of Language: Explore the neurobiological basis of speech

[Source](https://kill-the-newsletter.com/feeds/38e64wkp9h1pgiw8fsk0/entries/2c39vcthwzuwj4z7cski.html)

_Neurobiology of Language_, a gold open access journal from MIT Press, focuses on the neurobiological basis of speech and language. It features rigorous peer review, quick turnaround, and open science practices. Volume 6 is dedicated to the white matter connectome supporting speech and language, with articles on overnight consolidation of speech sounds and the impact of COVID-19 on the reading network. A call for papers is announced for a special issue on the cellular and molecular neuroscience of language disorders, focusing on primary progressive aphasias, with a deadline of December 31, 2025.

## Affordances in the brain: The human superpower AI hasnt mastered

[Source](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250622225921.htm)

University of Amsterdam researchers found that the human brain instinctively understands "affordances," or how to interact with different environments, activating specific brain regions. AI models like ChatGPT struggle with this intuitive understanding, highlighting a key difference between human and artificial intelligence. The researchers suggest incorporating this knowledge of human brain function could make AI more efficient, sustainable, and human-friendly.

## The effect of degree of prediction error elicited by retrieval on the reconsolidation of fear memory

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725001647?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This ScienceDirect page is an article preview for a study published in the journal *Cognition* (October 2025). The article, "The effect of degree of prediction error elicited by retrieval on the reconsolidation of fear memory," investigates how different manipulations of prediction error (PE) during memory retrieval affect fear memory reconsolidation. The study uses a reinforcement learning model to quantify PE and relates it to skin conductance responses. The findings suggest that the overall degree of PE elicited during retrieval, a combination of size, type, and number, influences the reconsolidation process. The study aims to clarify the role of PE in the retrieval-extinction paradigm to promote clinical translation.

## Iterated Learning

[Source](https://oecs.mit.edu/pub/boh416wu)

This page from the Open Encyclopedia of Cognitive Science defines and discusses "Iterated Learning," a process where individuals learn from others who learned the same way. It highlights that this process, often studied through transmission chains, is influenced by biases in learning and reproduction, ultimately shaping the systems of knowledge or behavior that emerge. The article explores the history, core concepts, experimental applications across various domains (language, music, social stereotypes), current debates, and broader connections to fields like social learning and cultural evolution. It also provides further reading and citation information. The site uses cookies for traffic analysis but does not share personal data.

## Supervenience

[Source](https://oecs.mit.edu/pub/52v2eei4)

This is an entry on "Supervenience" from the Open Encyclopedia of Cognitive Science. Supervenience describes a relationship where one phenomenon depends on another, such that duplicating the base states would also duplicate the higher-level states. It was initially used in ethics and later in philosophy of mind, however, while useful for expressing determination claims, supervenience doesn't fully capture the underlying reasons or mechanisms behind these relationships. It can occur without actual determination and is being superseded by the concept of "grounding." The article discusses core concepts, controversies, and broader connections to other level-linking notions in philosophy and science. The site uses cookies, but does not share personal data.

## The one true philosophical theory of names

[Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ya1PrgkOO98)

Jeffrey Kaplan is writing a book presenting his "one true philosophical theory of names." He's also made videos explaining Kripke's and Searle's theories. A lecture video summarizes Gareth Evans's causal theory of names, arguing it resolves the debate about how proper names function by suggesting names refer to the dominant causal source of associated descriptions. He highlights the Madagascar example and notes the Napoleon example's similarity to the plot of Mad Men.
