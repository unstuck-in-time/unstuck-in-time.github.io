## A rational process model of reasoning causally with continuous variables

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725001337?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This is a preview of an article titled "A rational process model of reasoning causally with continuous variables" published in the journal Cognition. The study investigates how people make causal inferences with continuous variables, specifically in common cause networks with both generative and inhibitory relationships. The research extends the "mutation sampler" model, a rational process model, to explain observed errors in human causal reasoning with continuous variables, finding similar error patterns as with binary variables. The study involves participants performing causal reasoning tasks while pretending to be physiologists studying biological processes. The results suggest that the sampling process of the mutation sampler has a quantitative effect on causal inferences.

## Understanding of exact equality emerges after and builds on symbolic number knowledge 1

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725001660?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This ScienceDirect article investigates the relationship between symbolic number knowledge and understanding of exact equality in preschool children. The study replicates and extends previous findings, suggesting that understanding exact equality emerges after and builds upon symbolic number knowledge. The research utilized set-matching tasks and assessments of executive functions, finding that children with a better grasp of symbolic numbers (CP-knowers) performed better on set-matching tasks, even when controlling for age and executive function skills.

This is a webpage for the "Trends in Cognitive Sciences" journal. It includes login/registration options, access to the current article ("And yet, the hippocampus codes conjunctively"), article information, related articles, journal navigation, and cookie consent information. The article is a letter discussing hippocampal coding and addresses issues like single-trial reinstatement, episode-specific neurons, repeated-story paradigms, and concept cells.

## Violations of social expectations enhance infants' learning

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725001672?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This ScienceDirect article, "Violations of Social Expectations Enhance Infants' Learning," published in Cognition, explores whether infants learn better when they observe violations of social expectations, similar to how they learn from surprising physical events. The study presents three experiments involving 16- to 19-month-old infants, showing that surprising social behaviors, like unexpected emotional reactions or changes in preference, do enhance learning about both the objects and the people involved.

## Looking deeper into the algorithms underlying human planning

[Source](https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(25)00152-4?rss=yes)

This document is a scientific article titled "Looking deeper into the algorithms underlying human planning" published in Trends in Cognitive Sciences. It discusses computational frameworks for modeling human planning, focusing on decision tree search, normative models for efficient resource use, and applications of AI in understanding sequential decision-making. It covers topics like experimental probes for heuristics, artificial neural networks, and the roles of various brain regions in planning. It is available for purchase and includes references, a glossary, figures, and related articles. There is also information about Cell Press journals, publishing options, and website navigation.
