## The first attribute heuristic influences risky choice preferences

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725002380?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This article from *Cognition* journal (volume 266, January 2026) explores the "First Attribute Heuristic (FAH)" in risky decision-making. Through three studies, the authors demonstrate that individuals tend to prioritize the first contextually available attribute (e.g., probability or money) when making choices, favoring options with dominant values on that attribute. This heuristic, which influences preference construction, is not accounted for by established behavioral theories. The study provides empirical evidence for the FAH and its impact on human preferences, judgments, and decisions.

## AI has no idea what its doing, but its threatening us all

[Source](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250907172635.htm)

A Charles Darwin University study warns that rapid AI development, lacking adequate human-centered regulation, threatens human dignity and fundamental rights. The "black box problem" makes it difficult to trace and challenge potentially harmful AI decisions. The study advocates for a global commitment to ethical AI development, prioritizing human values over data-driven efficiency.

## Combining and integrating multiple linguistic cues during spoken language comprehension: A focus on semantics and coarticulation

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725002409?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This ScienceDirect article from the journal *Cognition* (January 2026) explores how adults integrate semantic and coarticulatory cues during spoken language comprehension. Using an eye-tracking paradigm, the study found that adult listeners are sensitive to both semantic context and coarticulation, and that their processing of acoustic cues is influenced by earlier semantic information. The research supports Martin's cue integration model, suggesting that listeners dynamically weigh and update the reliability of cues across multiple levels of linguistic representation. The article includes details on methodology, results, discussion, data availability, and supplementary materials, including the full list of stimuli and detailed acoustic measurements.

## Foundations of Rationality

[Source](https://oecs.mit.edu/pub/hggua2hs)

This excerpt from the Open Encyclopedia of Cognitive Science presents an article titled "Foundations of Rationality" by Nick Chater, published on September 10, 2025. The article explores the concept of rationality in cognitive science, its historical development, and ongoing debates surrounding its application to human thought and behavior. It discusses formal models of rationality, apparent irrationalities observed in experiments, and emerging perspectives on rationality as a social phenomenon.

## Interoception

[Source](https://oecs.mit.edu/pub/h6pgywr9)

This is an article titled "Interoception" by Catherine Tallon-Baudry, published in the Open Encyclopedia of Cognitive Science. Interoception is defined as the brain's sensing of internal physiological signals, consciously or unconsciously, which influences physiological regulation, behavior, and potentially contributes to conscious experience. The article discusses the history, core concepts, challenges in measuring interoception, its connection to emotions and the self, and its broader connections to cognitive science.

## The effects of beliefs on correcting misinformation in memory

People's pre-existing beliefs impact how effectively they correct misinformation stored in their memory.

## Live questions about the minds eye

Humans spend much time imagining, often using sensory imagery. Recent research focuses on aphantasia (lack of visual imagery, ~4% of people) and hyperphantasia (extremely vivid imagery), highlighting the spectrum of human imagination.

## Temporal sequence of morpheme boundary detection and positional encoding in the early stage of visual morphologically complex word recognition: an ERP study on Korean words

[Source](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23273798.2025.2552189?af=R)

An ERP study on Korean words investigates how the brain processes complex word recognition by examining the timing of morpheme boundary detection and positional encoding (order of morphemes) in the early stages of visual processing.

## The impact of distractor processing on semantic memory retrieval: The role of interference-by-process and inhibition

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725002550?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This ScienceDirect article preview summarizes a study on the impact of distractor processing on semantic memory retrieval. The study, comprised of four experiments, investigates how different types of distractors (acoustic vs. semantic) affect semantic memory retrieval under varying levels of cognitive control. The findings suggest that meaningful distractors disrupt semantic memory retrieval primarily through an "interference-by-process" mechanism, where incidental distractor processing evokes task-irrelevant activation within the semantic network. The study proposes an activation-suppression framework where cognitive control plays a role in managing semantic distraction during retrieval.

## Creativity, the fountain of youth: Association between creativity and semantic memory networks across the lifespan

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725002598?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This ScienceDirect article examines the relationship between creativity and semantic memory networks in younger and older adults.  The study found that older adults typically exhibit a more rigid semantic memory structure associated with lower creative performance. However, higher creative older adults showed a preservation of semantic memory flexibility, similar to younger adults. The study suggests that creativity may play a protective role in maintaining cognitive flexibility during aging.
