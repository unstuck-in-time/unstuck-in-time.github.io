This is a weekly newsletter based on my RSS feeds. I have an LLM pipeline select the most relevant articles from my feeds (based on the about page of this website) and summarize them. 


## People can infer the magnitude of other peoples knowledge even when they cannot infer its contents

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725001763?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This is an article preview from ScienceDirect about a study on how people infer the magnitude of others' knowledge, even when they can't pinpoint the exact content of that knowledge. The authors present a computational model and two experiments demonstrating that people can make quantitatively precise judgments about how much someone knows based on minimal behavioral evidence, suggesting this ability is part of our broader "Theory of Mind." They compare their model to simpler heuristics and discuss the implications for social interaction.

## Word and construction probabilities explain the acceptability of certain long-distance dependency structures

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725002057?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This ScienceDirect article preview summarizes a study investigating the role of word and construction probabilities in the acceptability of long-distance dependency structures in sentences, specifically wh-questions. The study builds upon previous research suggesting that the probability of verb-frames influences acceptability and explores whether simpler probability-based accounts (lexeme and construction probabilities) can better explain the data. The authors reanalyze existing data, conduct replications and extensions to adjective-frames, and combine corpus analyses with acceptability-judgment data to test their hypotheses. They conclude that the acceptability of such constructions is higher the more probable the words and constructions that make up the sentence are.

## The effects of inoculation interventions and repetition on perceived truth in younger and older adults

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001002772500215X?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This ScienceDirect page previews an article titled "The effects of inoculation interventions and repetition on perceived truth in younger and older adults," published in Cognition, Volume 265, December 2025. The study investigates whether inoculation interventions (learning about misinformation techniques) can improve truth discernment in younger and older adults, especially when misinformation is repeated. It examines the "illusory truth effect" (repetition increasing perceived truth), and whether inoculation can reduce it, and if the effect of inoculation varies by age. The study also investigates the specificity of inoculation, whether it works only for specific misinformation techniques or is more general. The study tests whether counterarguing and threat mediate the relationship between inoculation intervention and discernment scores. The study found that the illusory truth effect was larger for older adults and on the delayed test. Inoculation did not improve discernment or reduce the illusory truth effect. Counterarguing was associated with higher discernment.

## Braincomputer interfaces as a causal probe for scientific inquiry

[Source](https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(25)00180-9?rss=yes)

Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) offer a novel method for perturbing neural activity by leveraging volitional control, allowing for flexible and accurate manipulation within intrinsic brain constraints. This approach allows researchers to investigate the causal relationships between neural activity and brain function, offering advantages and expanding research possibilities compared to traditional perturbation methods.

## Psychopathy | Video | Magic Realism | Buddhism | Gaming Cancer

[Source](https://kill-the-newsletter.com/feeds/38e64wkp9h1pgiw8fsk0/entries/bxvbbiku9a330f3xgzm3.html)

This MIT Press Reader newsletter highlights new articles on topics including: MRI research on psychopathy and why some scientists portray it as a neurodevelopmental disorder despite a lack of clear evidence, the "we evolved to eat meat" argument, the metaphysical foundations of Buddhism, pregnancy as a fashion statement, what designers can learn from magic realism, gaming's potential in curing disease, the lack of tools to dissect video like print, writing as a skill sustained by discipline, and Abbas Kiarostami's cinema.

## BI 217 Jennifer Prendki: Consciousness, Life, AI, and Quantum Physics

[Source](https://braininspired.co/podcast/217/)

Brain Inspired podcast episode 217 features Jennifer Prendki discussing the need for AI to draw inspiration from biology, life, and possibly consciousness to advance beyond current limitations. Prendki, a former particle physicist and AI expert, believes that scaling AI alone will not suffice and that understanding processes found only in living organisms, like the integration of brains with bodies and possibly consciousness itself, is crucial for enhancing AI and ensuring its responsible development. The conversation covers consciousness, superalignment, quantum physics, wetware, AI ethics, and the limitations of current AI models.

## Tackling challenges in the study of animal emotions: a review

[Source](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02699931.2025.2534728?ai=2a7&mi=3dg6fv&af=R)

A review of the challenges in studying animal emotions, likely highlighting the difficulties in objectively identifying and interpreting emotional states in non-human animals.

## Motivated information search: Context-dependent efficiency in children and adults

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725002185?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This article investigates how social goals impact information search efficiency in children, adolescents, and adults, using a modified 20-Questions game. Two studies reveal that participants across age groups strategically adjust their information search based on the perceived benefits or drawbacks for their team, suggesting that social context significantly influences information gathering. The research highlights the importance of considering context-dependent motivations when studying information search strategies, with potential implications for understanding phenomena like political polarization and media consumption.
