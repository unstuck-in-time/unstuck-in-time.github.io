## Self-powered artificial synapse mimics human color vision

[Source](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250602155323.htm)

Researchers at the Tokyo University of Science have created a self-powered artificial synapse that mimics human color vision. This device, using dye-sensitized solar cells, can distinguish colors with high resolution and perform complex logic operations without external power, making it suitable for energy-efficient edge computing applications like autonomous vehicles, healthcare wearables, and smartphones. The device achieved 82% accuracy in recognizing human movements recorded in different colors, demonstrating its potential for low-power AI systems with visual recognition.

## BI 213 Representations in Minds and Brains

[Source](https://braininspired.co/podcast/213/)

This is a webpage for Brain Inspired podcast episode 213, titled "Representations in Minds and Brains." The episode features a discussion between neuroscientists and philosophers on the meaning and use of the term "representation" in cognitive science. It provides links to support the show, access episodes, join a complexity group, student login, and about information. It also provides links to subscribe to the podcast and share the episode on social media.

## Aphantasia as a functional disconnection

[Source](https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(25)00124-X?rss=yes)

Aphantasia may stem from reduced functional connectivity between visual processing areas (specifically the left fusiform imagery node) and frontoparietal regions in the brain, despite typical activation of visual cortices during imagery tasks.

## Estimating divergent moral and diversity preferences between AI builders and AI users

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725001386?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This ScienceDirect article investigates potential value divergences between AI builders and AI users, focusing on moral beliefs (utilitarianism) and diversity preferences. The study, using a pseudo-experimental design with adults and adolescents, finds that higher AI engagement is linked to stronger utilitarian tendencies and weaker support for diversity, especially among males. The authors suggest demographic homogeneity in the AI workforce, particularly gender imbalance, may contribute to these differences, potentially leading to AI systems that don't fully align with broader societal values. They stress the need for a more diverse AI workforce to ensure alignment with societal values.

## Why Different Neuron Parts Learn Differently?

Artem Kirsanov, a researcher at NYU and Flatiron Institute, discusses a Science study showing that different compartments of pyramidal neurons (apical vs. basal dendrites) employ distinct plasticity rules for learning. The video explores synaptic transmission, LTP, Hebbian and non-Hebbian plasticity, the study's hypothesis, experimental methods, and resulting compartmentalized plasticity.

## Psychological distance to science

[Source](https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(25)00121-4?rss=yes)

Psychological distance makes science feel irrelevant to daily life, leading to rejection and distrust. Reducing this distance increases trust in science.

## fMRI decoders: unlike the baby, wishful thinking is alive and well

[Source](https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(25)00117-2?rss=yes)

The authors stand by their claim that fMRI decoding models, no matter how specific, cannot distinguish between true neural mechanisms and their epiphenomena. They argue that Lee et al.'s attempt to improve model specificity doesn't address this fundamental limitation, reiterating previously detailed fallacies.

## Neural decoders: saving the baby from the bathwater

[Source](https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(25)00077-4?rss=yes)

Vigotsky et al. critique fMRI-based neural decoders, arguing they lack scientific validity due to nonspecific signals. While acknowledging the need for rigorous validity testing, the critique overstates the problem and ignores ongoing efforts to improve decoding model validity.

## The role of motivation in delayed disengagement from threat in anxiety

[Source](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02699931.2025.2514625?ai=2a7&mi=3dg6fv&af=R)

Anxiety can cause people to struggle to disengage from perceived threats, and motivation plays a significant role in this difficulty.

## Pupil responses to emotion regulation strategies: the role of attachment orientations

[Source](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02699931.2025.2512886?ai=2a7&mi=3dg6fv&af=R)

Pupil dilation, an indicator of cognitive effort, is affected by the use of emotion regulation strategies. Attachment style influences this relationship, suggesting that different attachment orientations impact how individuals process and regulate emotions.

## Everything is going to be okay: emotion regulation and immune neglect in affective forecasting

[Source](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02699931.2025.2511974?ai=2a7&mi=3dg6fv&af=R)

People tend to overestimate the emotional impact of future events, neglecting their ability to regulate their emotions and the role of the immune system in recovery, leading to inaccurate affective forecasts.
