This is a weekly newsletter based on my RSS feeds. I have an LLM pipeline select the most relevant articles from my feeds (based on the about page of this website) and summarize them. 


## Environmental context scaffolds children's semantic representation of novel words

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725001027?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This ScienceDirect article details a study examining how environmental context influences preschoolers' semantic understanding of novel words.  Researchers found that 3-year-olds used context-related verbs (e.g., "eat" in a kitchen scene) to predict novel object labels, demonstrating that they integrated environmental information into their word meanings.  The study's data and analysis scripts are publicly accessible.

## Loopholes: A window into value alignment and the communication of meaning

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001002772500071X?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This is a ScienceDirect page displaying a full-length article titled "Loopholes: A window into value alignment and the communication of meaning."  The article investigates intentional misunderstandings (loopholes) in communication, exploring their prevalence, function in social interactions, and implications for AI safety.  Three studies are presented: one surveying real-world loophole experiences, another evaluating people's judgments of loophole behavior versus compliance/non-compliance, and a third examining predictions of loophole use based on goal alignment and power dynamics.  The findings suggest loopholes are distinct from simple non-compliance and are strategically employed, particularly when goals conflict and the cost of direct refusal is high.

## Observed reaching speed signals stimulus value and informs foraging

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725000885?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This ScienceDirect article investigates how observed reaching speed influences foraging behavior.  Four experiments demonstrate that faster reaching movements towards a stimulus are interpreted by observers as signaling higher value. This perception then affects observers' foraging choices and the amount of time and effort they invest in exploiting a resource. The study highlights the role of action understanding and social learning in optimal foraging decisions, suggesting that observers can infer stimulus value from subtle kinematic cues without explicit communication.

## The specificity of sequential statistical learning: Statistical learning accumulates predictive information from unstructured input but is dissociable from (declarative) memory for words

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725000708?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This is a ScienceDirect article from the journal *Cognition* investigating the role of statistical learning in word segmentation.  Through computational modeling and two experiments, the authors challenge the notion that statistical learning creates declarative memories of words.  Their findings suggest statistical learning primarily facilitates predictive processing in continuous speech, but is dissociable from the memory mechanisms needed for word acquisition and boundary identification.  Pre-segmented speech, mimicking prosodic cues, was necessary for participants to recall words, highlighting the importance of cues beyond statistical regularities in word learning.

## Common and distinct neural substrates of rule- and similarity-based category learning

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725000836?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This is a ScienceDirect article preview for a study on the neural substrates of rule-based and similarity-based category learning.  Using EEG-fNIRS, three experiments compared brain activity while participants learned categories using either instructed or self-discovered strategies. Results suggest distinct neural mechanisms: rule-based learning involves hypothesis testing and semantic processing (larger P300, N400, Wernicke's area activation), while similarity-based learning relies on visual processing and feature integration (larger P1, frontopolar cortex activation).  These findings support a multiple-system (COVIS) model over single-system accounts of category learning.

## Semantic extension in a novel communication system is facilitated by salient shared associations

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725000691?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This ScienceDirect article presents two experiments investigating semantic extension in novel communication systems.  Participants, working in pairs, used geometric shapes to label shapes, colors, objects, and emotions. Experiment 1 showed that consistent shape-color pairings facilitated initial extension and subsequent chaining of extensions to more abstract concepts.  Experiment 2, with a between-subjects design and shape remapping, confirmed these findings, highlighting the role of shared associations in successful communication.  The study reveals that metonymic extensions are more frequent than metaphorical ones, and that the strength of grounding influences extension success.  Unexpectedly, pre-existing non-arbitrary associations between shapes, colors, and emotions also played a significant role.  The authors propose this experimental paradigm as a flexible tool for further research into semantic extension and language evolution.

## 'Influential Papers' Feed - 5 New Papers

[Source](https://kill-the-newsletter.com/feeds/ds7kuqx2r8383zq9o3d1/entries/3fwztzpu5qbx2lqk6dd0.html)

This is a Semantic Scholar weekly digest (April 28 - May 4) featuring five research papers on AI awareness.  The papers cover topics such as:  the different forms of AI awareness,  the evolution of human consciousness (challenging the idea it's a gradual development), a dual-channel AI architecture for human-aligned systems, a categorical model of general consciousness, and bridging the cognition gap between humans and ChatGPT using ACT-R.

## Object- and feature-based working memory limits for pairs of complex objects and their development during the school years

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725001039?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This is a ScienceDirect article preview for a study published in *Cognition* examining the development of working memory capacity for complex objects in children aged 8â€“12 years and young adults.  The research challenges previous findings by demonstrating that feature richness, not just object number, significantly impacts working memory development.  A two-step model of object and feature encoding is proposed.  The full text and data are available online.

## A hierarchical model of early brain functional network development

[Source](https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(25)00080-4?rss=yes)

This is a webpage for *Trends in Cognitive Sciences*, a Cell Press journal.  The page features an article, "A hierarchical model of early brain functional network development," by Wei Gao.  The article proposes a developmental hierarchy of brain networks, progressing from primary sensory/motor to socioemotional, and finally to cognitive/executive control networks.  It discusses the timing of this development, its relationship to behavior, the impact of risk factors, and potential therapeutic interventions.  The webpage also includes a login section, journal information, and other Cell Press publications.

## BI 211 COGITATE: Testing Theories of Consciousness

[Source](https://braininspired.co/podcast/211/)

Brain Inspired podcast episode 211 discusses the COGITATE project, an adversarial collaboration testing Integrated Information Theory and Global Neuronal Workspace Theory of consciousness.  Using EEG, MEG, and fMRI, researchers tested predictions about the location, duration, and connectivity of consciousness-related brain activity.  Results were inconclusive, neither fully falsifying either theory, but providing valuable data for future research.  The episode features interviews with three researchers involved in the project and their published paper in Nature.
