## Rules in the mist: Emerging probabilistic rules in uncertain categorization

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725002045?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This ScienceDirect article preview summarizes a study on probabilistic category learning, investigating how people learn rules under uncertain feedback and transfer that knowledge to similarity judgments. The study challenges the traditional dual-system theory of category learning, suggesting that a single system (either rule-based or similarity-based) can adapt to probabilistic settings effectively. Two experiments were conducted, with results showing that feedback reliability during training correlates with performance in subsequent tasks. The authors propose that current dual-system models need revision to accommodate these findings. The study's open data is available on OSF.

## Recalling sequences from memory can explain the distribution of recursive structures in natural languages

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725001842?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This is a ScienceDirect article preview for a *Cognition* journal article titled "Recalling sequences from memory can explain the distribution of recursive structures in natural languages." The article explores why center-embedded recursive structures are prevalent in languages compared to crossed-dependent structures, proposing that memory retrieval mechanisms, specifically backward recall, make center-embedding more efficient for language processing. The article includes an abstract, section snippets, references, author information, and links for access/purchase. It also contains information about cookies used by the site.

## Self-portrait of a stranger: Self-face representation and interoception in depersonalization experiences

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001002772500201X?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This ScienceDirect article investigates the relationship between depersonalization (DP) experiences, self-face representation, and interoceptive sensibility.  The study found that individuals with higher DP symptoms had less accurate but more precise (detailed) self-face representations. These representations were perceived as younger and more emotionless by independent raters. Anomalous memory experiences, specifically visual imagery difficulty and déjà vu, were linked to self-face representation accuracy and precision, respectively. Additionally, higher interoceptive sensibility correlated with more accurate self-face representations, independent of DP symptoms. The authors conclude that bodily self-awareness, memory, and interoception are crucial factors in understanding depersonalization.

## People make suboptimal decisions about existential risks

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725001568?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This ScienceDirect article, published in *Cognition*, investigates how people allocate resources to mitigate existential risks, which have a multiplicative (rather than additive) incentive structure.  The authors find that people systematically deviate from optimal strategies, tending to allocate resources more evenly than is ideal and failing to prioritize risks with lower baseline survival probabilities, even when information is framed to emphasize survival probabilities.  They propose a heuristic model that better captures human decision-making in this context.  The research highlights a flaw in people's intuitions about multiplicative objectives and suggests that presenting competing total allocation profiles might improve decision-making regarding existential risks.

## Compass Pathway's Dr. Steve Levine

In a CogNation podcast episode, Dr. Steve Levine, Chief Patient Officer at Compass Pathways, discusses the company's research into Comp360, a synthetic form of psilocybin, for treating treatment-resistant depression. He explains the challenges of drug development, the importance of FDA approval for insurance coverage and patient access, and the design of clinical trials. He emphasizes the potential of psilocybin and other psychedelics to provide new treatment options and addresses the complexities of placebo effects in psychedelic trials. He also discusses Compass Pathway's work in other indications, such as PTSD and anorexia. Finally, he expresses excitement about the potential for new, effective, and accessible psychiatric treatments in the future.

## Are your eyes following your thoughts? Exploring individual differences in internal coupling

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725002070?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This ScienceDirect article explores individual differences in "internal coupling," the phenomenon of eye movements aligning with internal cognitive processes during a visuospatial working memory task. The study tests two competing hypotheses: the Compensation Hypothesis (coupling compensates for lower cognitive resources) and the Quality of Image Hypothesis (coupling reflects the quality of mental imagery). Results showed a strong effect of the availability of a spatial reference (empty matrix) on the internal coupling rate. While neither hypothesis was fully supported, the study found that higher spatial working memory capacity related to more coupling when no spatial reference was available, in support of the Quality of Image Hypothesis. The authors conclude that internal coupling may involve both compensatory and attentional mechanisms and that a large portion of individual variance remains unexplained, possibly due to learned patterns and idiosyncrasies.

## Image primitives supporting perception of animate forms

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725001982?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This document is a scientific article published in the journal *Cognition* about pareidolia, the phenomenon of seeing familiar forms in ambiguous patterns. The study uses synthetic noise patterns to investigate how spatiotemporal characteristics and symmetry influence the perception of animate forms, particularly faces. Three experiments demonstrate that pareidolia is tuned to natural scene statistics and biased towards animate forms, especially in vertically symmetrical patterns. The research establishes synthetic noise patterns as a useful tool for pareidolia research.

## A simple twist fooled AIand revealed a dangerous flaw in medical ethics

[Source](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/07/250723045711.htm)

A 2025 study from Mount Sinai reveals that AI models like ChatGPT can make surprisingly simple errors in medical ethics scenarios, even when given clear information. By tweaking well-known dilemmas, researchers found AI often defaults to intuitive but incorrect answers, raising concerns about relying on AI for critical healthcare decisions without human oversight.
