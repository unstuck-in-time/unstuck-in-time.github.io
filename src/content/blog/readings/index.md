This is a weekly newsletter based on my RSS feeds. I have an LLM pipeline select the most relevant articles from my feeds (based on the about page of this website) and summarize them. 


## Curiosity overpowers cognitive effort avoidance tendencies

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725001076?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This ScienceDirect article, "Curiosity overpowers cognitive effort avoidance tendencies," explores the relationship between curiosity and cognitive effort. Through three experiments, the authors found that people are willing to exert cognitive effort (performing difficult tasks) to satisfy their curiosity (find answers to trivia questions), but only when there is no less effortful alternative. The study suggests that curiosity acts as an intrinsic reward, outweighing the natural tendency to avoid cognitive effort, and contributing to the cost-benefit analysis of human decision-making.

## Sensorimotor awareness requires intention: Evidence from minuscule eye movements

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725001167?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This ScienceDirect article investigates the relationship between intention and awareness of microsaccades (tiny eye movements). The study compared intentional, unintentional, and spontaneous microsaccades, manipulating visual consequences to isolate the role of intention. The findings suggest that intention enhances sensorimotor awareness, even for actions typically below conscious detection, while visual consequences alone do not.

## (Un)intentionality bias in action observation revisited

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725001313?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This ScienceDirect article, titled "(Un)intentionality bias in action observation revisited," investigates how people distinguish between intentional and unintentional actions by observing a finger attached to a pulling device. The study found that participants use strategies like assessing action onset and finger posture to infer intentionality, with bent fingers being perceived as more intentional than straight fingers. Individual schizotypal cognitive style also influenced perceived intentionality. The authors conclude that intentionality attribution isn't an automatic process, but requires integrating cognitive processes modulated by individual differences. The article includes an abstract, introduction, methodology, results, discussion, conclusion, data availability statement, and references.

## Could AI understand emotions better than we do?

[Source](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/05/250522124755.htm)

A new study shows that generative AIs, including ChatGPT, outperform humans on emotional intelligence tests and can even create new tests quickly. This suggests AI could be used in areas like education and conflict management, traditionally reserved for humans.

## Defending the foundation model view of infant development

[Source](https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(25)00119-6?rss=yes)

Zettersten et al. challenge the idea of stage-like infant development, arguing for a "foundation model" where infants learn statistical regularities. While Zettersten et al. imply this model excludes motivation, the original authors clarify that foundation models can incorporate motivations like curiosity.

## BI 212 John Beggs: Why Brains Seek the Edge of Chaos

[Source](https://braininspired.co/podcast/212/)

This is a summary of Brain Inspired podcast episode 212 featuring John Beggs discussing the critical brain hypothesis. The hypothesis posits that brain activity operates near criticality, a balance between order and chaos, which optimizes computing and information transfer. Beggs has studied criticality for over 20 years and wrote a book on the subject. The episode covers what criticality is, how it's measured, criticisms of the hypothesis, and its relevance to AI. Listeners can support the show on Patreon for full episodes and access to a Discord community. A transcript is available via The Transmitter.

## Sensorimotor mismatch but not rotational inertia contributes to the size-weight illusion and weight perception for handheld objects

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725001106?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This ScienceDirect article, "Sensorimotor mismatch but not rotational inertia contributes to the size-weight illusion and weight perception for handheld objects," investigates the role of rotational inertia in the size-weight illusion (SWI) and weight perception. Two experiments were conducted using handheld spheres. The study found no significant impact of rotational inertia on weight perception or the magnitude of the SWI. Instead, the study found that lifting force correlated with perceived weight, suggesting that sensorimotor mismatches contribute to the SWI. The authors conclude that rotational inertia's influence may be limited to specific contexts involving rod-based objects, highlighting the importance of lifting dynamics in understanding weight perception. The data is available through OSF.

## Speech categorization consistency is associated with language and reading abilities in school-age children: Implications for language and reading disorders

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725001349?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This is an article preview from ScienceDirect about a study investigating the relationship between speech categorization consistency and language/reading abilities in school-age children. The study uses a visual analog scaling (VAS) task to measure speech categorization in a sample including children with language and/or reading disabilities. The findings suggest that categorization consistency, rather than the quality of representations, is uniquely linked to language/reading ability, even when controlling for phonological processing. The study aims to overcome limitations of prior research by examining both language and reading abilities simultaneously, assessing various phonetic contrasts, and utilizing the VAS task to identify novel dimensions of speech categorization.

## Agency, desire, and the conceptual representation of consent

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725001301?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This ScienceDirect article explores the conceptual representation of consent through a series of studies using experimental and computational methods. The research indicates that consent is primarily associated with a patient's instrumental acceptance of an action, rather than intrinsic desire, and is more acceptable when given by someone in a patient role. The article argues that this understanding of consent may conflict with the normative expectations in certain domains, such as sexual relationships, where intrinsic desire is often considered essential.

## Indexing prediction error during syntactic priming via pupillometry

[Source](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23273798.2025.2506634?af=R)

The Taylor & Francis Online page provides access to academic journals and ebooks across a wide range of subjects. It offers options to browse content, publish research, and search for specific articles. A recent article focuses on using pupillometry to measure prediction error during syntactic priming and its relationship to error-based learning. The study found that pupil dilation, indexing prediction error, predicts syntactic priming, but that this relationship might weaken as participants adapt to the experimental context.

## When and why people do NOT regulate their emotions: examining the reasons and contexts

[Source](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02699931.2025.2504560?ai=2a7&mi=3dg6fv&af=R)

People sometimes fail to regulate their emotions for various reasons and in specific situations. The question is: what are these reasons and contexts?
