## Learn what is detectable, detect what is useful: acquisition of German plural as a classification problem

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001002772500232X?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This ScienceDirect article discusses a new computational model for morphology that emphasizes task-specific linear processing, efficiency, and reliability, using the German nominal number system as a case study.  The model aims to address shortcomings in existing models that either rely on hand-coded linguistic knowledge or fail to adequately account for how speakers learn sublexical units.  The authors compare their model's performance to other state-of-the-art models and validate its predictions through a psycholinguistic experiment that explores how German native speakers identify plural markers.  The article argues for a chunk-based approach where speakers identify and use high-confidence, high-efficiency phonological chunks for morphological tasks, contributing to the emergence of morphological structure. It also includes appendices with experiment instructions, supplementary data, and a data availability statement.

## Probability errors in adults' and children's decision-making

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725002379?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This research paper investigates the conjunction fallacy, where people incorrectly judge the probability of two events happening together as higher than one of the events happening alone. The study explores whether this fallacy is caused by the "representativeness heuristic" (making judgments based on how well something fits a stereotype) in both adults and children. Three studies were conducted using poker chips/building blocks (objective probability) and social scenarios. The results suggest adults are influenced by the likelihood of winning, supporting the representativeness heuristic. Children, however, don't seem to use probabilities in their judgments. Interestingly, older children (10-11) and adults show a correlation between errors on objective and social tasks, suggesting a shared cognitive process. Finally, a "think aloud" experiment reduced errors in social judgments for adults, but not in objective probability, suggesting the representativeness heuristic mainly influences social judgement errors.

This is a weekly digest from Semantic Scholar, dated August 25-31, featuring papers from the user's "Influential Papers" feed. It highlights four papers: one on integrating AI and cognitive science, one on action unity of consciousness, one on computational phylogenesis of biological intelligence, and one on algorithmic AI consciousness. Each entry includes a brief summary (TLDR) and options to save the paper or mark it as not relevant. The email also includes links to view more papers, learn about TLDR summaries, and manage alert settings.

## Encouraging unitary and compositional representations for relational concept learning

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725002434?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This ScienceDirect article from the journal *Cognition* explores how unitary versus compositional representations impact relational concept learning. Three experiments tested whether encouraging subjects to use unitary (holistic) or compositional (structural) representations affected their performance on classification and inference tasks. The findings suggest that encouraging unitary representations generally leads to better learning, especially for inference-based tasks, implying that representing relational concepts as a whole unit may be more efficient than focusing on their structural interconnections. The authors also discuss the implications of their findings for current theories of analogical reasoning and education.

## The chicken and the egg: unraveling aspects of semantic change and how they relate to lexical acquisition

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725002410?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This ScienceDirect article, "The chicken and the egg: unraveling aspects of semantic change and how they relate to lexical acquisition," explores the complex relationship between how word meanings change over time and when those words are learned. It disentangles three aspects of semantic change: "wiggliness" (short-term fluctuation), "displacement" (long-term shift), and "diversification" (degree of polysemy). The study finds that early-acquired words tend to have low wiggliness and displacement but high diversification, suggesting a "chicken-and-egg" feedback loop where acquisition and semantic change mutually influence each other through differential cognitive mechanisms. The research uses statistical models and Bayesian networks to analyze a dataset combining age-of-acquisition norms, diachronic sense distributions, and word frequencies from the Corpus of Historical American English (COHA).

## Impaired pattern of cognitive control moderates attentional bias in individuals with social anxiety

[Source](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02699931.2025.2530653?ai=2a7&mi=3dg6fv&af=R)

Social anxiety's attentional bias is influenced by a person's difficulty with cognitive control.
