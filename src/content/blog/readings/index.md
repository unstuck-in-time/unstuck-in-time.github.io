Readings are a weekly newsletter based on my RSS feeds. I have an LLM pipeline selects the most relevant articles from my feeds (based on the about page of this website) and summarizes them. 


## Environmental context scaffolds children's semantic representation of novel words

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725001027?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This is a ScienceDirect page displaying a research article titled "Environmental context scaffolds children's semantic representation of novel words."  The study found that 3-year-old preschoolers used environmental context (kitchen vs. outdoors scenes) to understand the meaning of new words, demonstrating this by predicting word usage based on context-related verbs (e.g., "eat" for kitchen objects).  The data and analysis are publicly available.

## Loopholes: A window into value alignment and the communication of meaning

This is a ScienceDirect page displaying a full-length article titled "Loopholes: A window into value alignment and the communication of meaning."  The article, published in *Cognition*, investigates intentional misunderstandings (loopholes) in communication.  Three studies explore loophole behavior:  Study 1 examines real-world examples, Study 2 analyzes the perceived consequences of loopholes versus non-compliance, and Study 3 explores predictions about loophole use based on goal alignment and power dynamics.  The authors propose a framework for understanding loopholes and discuss implications for AI safety.

## Observed reaching speed signals stimulus value and informs foraging

This ScienceDirect article investigates whether observed reaching speed signals stimulus value and influences foraging behavior.  Four experiments using a novel "tree-shaker" task demonstrated that: 1)  reaching speed correlates with stimulus value (replicating prior research); 2) observers accurately infer stimulus value from observed reaching speed; 3) observed reaching speed influences observers' desire to forage the stimulus; and 4) observed reaching speed affects observers' foraging time and effort, with faster reaches leading to more investment.  The findings highlight the role of action understanding and perception-action coupling in social learning and optimal foraging, suggesting that observers utilize kinematic cues to infer value and guide their own resource acquisition decisions.

## The specificity of sequential statistical learning: Statistical learning accumulates predictive information from unstructured input but is dissociable from (declarative) memory for words

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725000708?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This is a ScienceDirect article from the journal *Cognition* investigating the role of statistical learning in word segmentation.  The authors challenge the prevailing view that statistical learning creates declarative memories of words, arguing instead that it primarily supports predictive processing.  Through computational modeling and two experiments, they demonstrate that while participants track statistical regularities in continuous speech, they rarely remember specific items.  Declarative memory of words only emerges when words are presented as pre-segmented units.  The findings suggest statistical learning and declarative memory are dissociable mechanisms with distinct functions in language acquisition.

## Common and distinct neural substrates of rule- and similarity-based category learning

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725000836?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This is a ScienceDirect article preview for a research paper titled "Common and distinct neural substrates of rule- and similarity-based category learning."  The study uses EEG-fNIRS to investigate whether rule-based and similarity-based category learning strategies rely on distinct or overlapping neural systems.  Three experiments, manipulating instruction and strategy discovery, reveal distinct neural correlates for each strategy: rule-based learning shows greater P300 and N400 activity and Wernicke's area activation, while similarity-based learning shows a larger P1 component and frontopolar cortex activation.  These findings support a multiple-system (COVIS) model over single-system accounts of category learning.

## Semantic extension in a novel communication system is facilitated by salient shared associations

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725000691?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This paper reports two experiments investigating semantic extension—the creative process of applying existing labels to new meanings—in a novel communication system.  Participants, working in pairs, used geometric shapes to label other shapes, then extended these labels to represent colors, objects, and finally, emotions.  Experiment 1 showed that consistent shape-color pairings facilitated initial extension and subsequent chaining of meanings, while Experiment 2, with a between-subjects design and shape remapping, confirmed these findings.  The results highlight the role of shared associations in successful semantic extension, with metonymic extensions proving more frequent than metaphorical ones.  Unexpectedly, pre-existing non-arbitrary associations between shapes, colors, and emotions also influenced communication success. The study provides a novel experimental paradigm for investigating semantic extension and its implications for language evolution and change.

## 'Influential Papers' Feed - 5 New Papers

[Source](https://kill-the-newsletter.com/feeds/ds7kuqx2r8383zq9o3d1/entries/3fwztzpu5qbx2lqk6dd0.html)

This is a Semantic Scholar weekly digest (April 28 - May 4) featuring five research papers on AI awareness.  The papers cover topics such as the different types of AI awareness, the evolution of human consciousness (challenging the idea of it as a gradual development),  a dual-channel intelligent architecture for human-aligned AI, a categorical model of general consciousness, and bridging the cognition gap between humans and ChatGPT using ACT-R.  Each paper includes a brief TLDR summary and options to save or dismiss the paper.
