## Agency, desire, and the conceptual representation of consent

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725001301?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This ScienceDirect article examines the conceptual representation of consent through a series of studies using linguistic analysis, experimental tasks, and natural language processing. The research suggests that consent is often associated with a "patient" role in interactions and indicates instrumental desire (desire as a means to an end) rather than intrinsic desire. The article concludes that this association may contribute to skepticism about consent's effectiveness in the sexual domain, where intrinsic desire is often expected, creating a mismatch between the concept of consent and prevailing moral norms.

## The role of attention and frames on third-party punishment and compensation choices

This ScienceDirect article, published in Cognition, investigates the impact of attention and information framing on third-party punishment and compensation choices in response to injustice. Through five experiments, the authors found that attention to the offender's payoff predicts punishment, while manipulating information frames (revealing either the offender's or victim's payoff) significantly influences decisions. They observed an "offender bias" where people tend to focus on the offender's outcomes, and that exposing individuals to information they wouldn't normally seek can shift their choices. While the role of empathy was not clear, the study suggests that bottom-up attentional mechanisms and information framing significantly shape moral decision-making, with implications for understanding information bubbles and promoting fairer outcomes.

## Gaze behavior in face-to-face interaction: A cross-cultural investigation between Japan and The Netherlands

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725001143?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This ScienceDirect article investigates cross-cultural differences in gaze behavior between Japanese and Dutch dyads during unstructured conversation and a collaborative Duplo model-copying task. The study examines gaze avoidance, gaze-gesture coupling, and gaze-action coupling. The findings suggest that Japanese participants consistently looked less at faces than Dutch participants. They also used fewer pointing gestures and kept their hands under the table more often. While visuomotor coordination was similar, extended gaze-action patterns diverged, potentially reflecting cultural strategies and error orientation styles. The study highlights the importance of assessing gaze behavior within the context of interaction and cultural differences.

## Children's reaction to unequal norm enforcement: The role of meta-norms in fairness judgments and emotion attributions

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725001374?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This ScienceDirect article preview summarizes research on children's understanding of fairness in punishment. Two studies examined how children aged 6-9 react to unequal punishment for the same transgression. The results indicate children expect consistent consequences based on a "meta-norm" of equal enforcement, and they attribute mixed emotions to both punished and unpunished individuals, suggesting punishment can offer emotional relief. The research contributes to understanding children's moral reasoning, fairness sensitivity, and emotional attributions.

## Reasoning and Argumentation

[Source](https://oecs.mit.edu/pub/wxnjre8g)

This is a summary of Hugo Mercier's article "Reasoning and Argumentation" published in the Open Encyclopedia of Cognitive Science. The article explores the relationship between individual reasoning and social argumentation, highlighting historical perspectives, core concepts like dual-process theory and the interactionist theory of reason, and current debates. These debates concern how individual reasoning relates to internalized argumentation, how well people reason together, the development of argumentation skills, and whether large language models can argue like humans. The article also touches upon broader connections to metarepresentational mechanisms and their social functions.

## Shared Intentionality

[Source](https://oecs.mit.edu/pub/sep9e3c2)

Michael Tomasello's article "Shared Intentionality" for the Open Encyclopedia of Cognitive Science explores humans' unique ability to collaborate and function as a "we," distinguishing it from other species. It discusses the evolution and development of joint and collective agencies, highlighting core concepts like joint goals, common ground, roles, coordination, and commitments. The article addresses controversies regarding shared intentionality in other primates and argues for its central role in human cognition, bridging psychology with social sciences like anthropology.

## Play

[Source](https://oecs.mit.edu/pub/y4e45rq6)

This article from the Open Encyclopedia of Cognitive Science defines "play" as intrinsically motivated behavior, often costly, pursued for idiosyncratic ends. It explores the history of understanding play, from early reinforcement theories to current cognitive perspectives. It discusses different accounts of play, including evolutionary spandrel, a signal of fitness, social bonding, practice, and learning. The article further examines the challenges in explaining human play and its potential connection to cognition, as well as broader connections to robotics and AI.

## Neuroscience of Syntax

[Source](https://oecs.mit.edu/pub/7n23j8sg)

This article, "Neuroscience of Syntax" published in the Open Encyclopedia of Cognitive Science, discusses how the brain processes syntax, the system of rules governing sentence construction. It refutes the idea of a single "syntax center," arguing instead for a distributed network within the left-lateralized frontal and temporal lobes. Syntactic processing is integrated with other language functions and relies on both predictive and integrative computations. Notably, brain areas involved in linguistic syntax are distinct from those processing structure in other domains.

## Sentence Processing

[Source](https://oecs.mit.edu/pub/mn7mjhx9)

This article from the Open Encyclopedia of Cognitive Science defines sentence processing as the study of how humans understand sentences, focusing on real-time comprehension and the integration of linguistic knowledge with world knowledge. It traces the history of the field, highlighting key theories like the Garden Path Theory and constraint-based parsing, and discusses core concepts such as processing complexity, local ambiguity, incremental processing, dependency formation, and priming. The article concludes by addressing current questions and controversies, including the role of AI, the need for broader linguistic diversity in research, and connections to neuroscience and language acquisition.
