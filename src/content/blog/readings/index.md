This is a weekly newsletter based on my RSS feeds. I have an LLM pipeline select the most relevant articles from my feeds (based on the about page of this website) and summarize them. 


## The origin of cognitive modules for face processing: A computational evolutionary perspective

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725002823?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This ScienceDirect page is an article preview for a "Cognition" journal article titled "The origin of cognitive modules for face processing: A computational evolutionary perspective." The study uses a computational model called the Dual-Task Meta-Learning Partitioned (DAMP) model to investigate how cognitive modules, particularly for face recognition, emerge through simulated evolution. The study found that specialized modules, not exclusive to faces, develop, influenced by sparse connectivity within the neural network, suggesting modularity is an adaptation to connection limitations. The model did not require pre-defined architectures or manual hyperparameter tuning, allowing architectures to emerge naturally without any prior hypotheses. The article also discusses the DAMP model, the stimuli and tasks used, and data availability.

## Contextual modulation of language comprehension in a dynamic neural model of lexical meaning

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001002772500277X?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This is a preview of an article titled "Contextual modulation of language comprehension in a dynamic neural model of lexical meaning" published in the journal *Cognition*. The article proposes a Dynamic Field Theory (DFT) model of lexical meaning, specifically focusing on the polysemous word "have". The model uses continuous dimensions of connectedness and control asymmetry to represent meaning, and simulations capture contextual modulation effects on sentence comprehension and individual variation. The study includes an experiment that supports the model's novel prediction about the relationship between reading time, acceptability, and context. The authors argue for a continuous, rather than discrete, representation of lexical meaning.

## Semantic memory network resilience in aging: The role of abstract and semantically diverse words

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001002772500280X?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This ScienceDirect article preview discusses a study investigating the impact of abstract words and semantic diversity on semantic memory network resilience in younger and older adults. The study found that including abstract words in semantic networks minimized age-related differences, made networks more interconnected and efficient, and that abstract and semantically diverse concepts remained connected longer under simulated 'attacks'. The research highlights the importance of considering abstract words and semantic diversity when studying semantic memory and aging, and it compares group-based and individual-based semantic memory network differences.

## The hidden costs of human cooperation

[Source](https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(25)00269-4?rss=yes)

This is a webpage for Cell Press's journal, Trends in Cognitive Sciences. The login page allows users to access their accounts, reset passwords, or create free accounts. There's an article titled "The Hidden Costs of Human Cooperation" available online, which explores the mechanisms that support cooperation, while also highlighting the negative social consequences like inequality, conflict, and environmental damage. It discusses various aspects of cooperation and its drawbacks, and has suggestions for future study. There are also links to Life & Medical Science journals, as well as Physical Sciences & Engineering journals, and Multidisciplinary journals.

## Embodiment effect on the comprehension of manual action language in L2: an EEG study

Taylor & Francis Online is a platform for academic journals and books, offering browsing, publishing, and search functionalities across various subjects. It provides open access options, author services, and tools for researchers, including personalized content alerts and citation export. The site also features a specific research article on the embodiment effect on language comprehension, accessible for purchase or via institutional login, and offers related articles and citation information.

## Preferences for consonance are evident in Indigenous Amazonians with higher, but not lower, levels of global integration

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725002744?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This ScienceDirect article investigates the impact of globalization on musical consonance preferences among the Tsimane', an indigenous Amazonian population. The study found that Tsimane' participants with greater integration into global culture, as measured by a self-constructed index, showed a preference for consonance over dissonance, unlike their less integrated counterparts. These results were further validated with control groups from Bolivian towns and US non-musicians, and are consistent with the idea that exposure to globalized culture influences music perception in small-scale societies. A pilot study using a slightly different integration measurement shows similar results.

## Fivetran + dbt Merge Official , Streaming DuckDB , LinkedIns Incremental ML 

[Source](https://kill-the-newsletter.com/feeds/dt7jkygkiv4fpb4yl0gb/entries/t7fm5fdw9dbbhjb7mmsa.html)

Fivetran's acquisition of dbt, following integrations with Tobiko Data and Census, is a significant consolidation move in the modern data stack, combining key data transformation, ingestion, and modeling tools. This unification streamlines workflows, but also raises concerns about the shrinking open-source landscape and potential feature divergence between dbt Core and dbt Fusion.
