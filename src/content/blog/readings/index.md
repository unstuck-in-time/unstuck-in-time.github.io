## A signaling theory of self-handicapping

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725002288?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This ScienceDirect article preview highlights a study on self-handicapping, where people deliberately hinder their performance to manage perceptions of their competence. The authors develop a signaling theory involving naive and sophisticated observers to explain when and why self-handicapping occurs.  Experiments tested the theory, finding self-handicapping is more likely when outcomes are less affected and when it boosts perceived competence, though sophisticated observers are less easily impressed by failure after self-handicapping. The theory aims to provide a computational understanding of self-handicapping and its interpretation.

## Say it again, you'll be faster: Or on how the language production system keeps track of co-occurrences

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725002574?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This article explores how language production is influenced by word co-occurrences. Through three experiments, the authors demonstrate that repeatedly producing the same adjective-noun phrases leads to faster subsequent production of those phrases compared to producing the same words in different combinations. This suggests the language production system keeps track of and is updated by direct word co-occurrences. Experiment 3 rules out that the improvement is due to mere repetition of the visual stimuli (pictures). The authors argue this challenges existing psycholinguistic models and propose incorporating connections between word representations to reflect co-occurrence frequencies. The study also explores the durability and potential non-linear effects of repeated exposure.

## Planning to be incremental: Scene descriptions reveal meaningful clustering in language production

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725002719?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This ScienceDirect article from the journal *Cognition* (January 2026) investigates how speakers plan and execute complex scene descriptions. The researchers hypothesize that speakers organize scenes into meaningful clusters, describing them incrementally, cluster by cluster. Results from a preregistered study support this, showing that objects with shorter physical and semantic distances are mentioned in closer temporal proximity. Jumping between clusters increases word production time, pause duration, and filler word usage, suggesting speakers plan between clusters. The study concludes that speakers address the linearization problem by establishing object clusters, facilitating incremental planning, and balancing exploration and exploitation like a foraging task. The study uses various analyses, including scene segmentation, object relation calculations, and verbal data coding, to reach its conclusions.

It provides a navigation menu with links to "About," "Episodes" (including categories and archives from 2020-2025), and social media. The latest episode, "Brains of a Feather," features an interview with neuroscientists discussing bird brains and behavior. The description includes notes, recommendations, and credits for the podcast's production.

## What is intelligence?

[Source](https://kill-the-newsletter.com/feeds/38e64wkp9h1pgiw8fsk0/entries/7ozg5iu0unghpvv4zv8j.html)

A new book, "What Is Intelligence?" by Blaise Ag√ºera y Arcas, explores the nature of intelligence and argues that AI's emergence is a natural consequence of evolution. The book posits that prediction is fundamental to intelligence, the brain, and life itself, and discusses the implications for computation in living systems, the origins of intelligence, models and reality, entropy, free will, consciousness, and AI ethics. The author also has a TED Talk.

## For everyday arguments prior beliefs play a larger role on perceived argument quality than argument quality itself

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725001970?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This ScienceDirect article explores how prior beliefs affect the evaluation of everyday arguments. Across three experiments, participants rated the quality of arguments on political topics, and the study found that while participants could differentiate between good and bad arguments, their prior beliefs had a larger impact on their ratings than the actual argument quality. Experiment 3 further found that participants preferred inconsistent arguments to authority-based arguments, and that even with these inconsistent arguments, prior beliefs still played a major role. The authors suggest these findings have implications for addressing misinformation and highlight the need for systemic interventions.

## Learning to be confident: How agents learn confidence based on prediction errors

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725002732?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This is a preview of a ScienceDirect article from the journal *Cognition* titled "Learning to be confident: How agents learn confidence based on prediction errors." The study investigates how humans learn to calibrate their confidence levels based on feedback and prediction errors in decision-making. The authors propose a neural network model to explain how confidence is dynamically updated by minimizing the difference between external feedback and internal confidence estimates. An experiment confirms that confidence ratings adapt to manipulated feedback, independent of objective performance.

## Online searching can lead to internet fixation without reducing metacognitive confidence

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725002707?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This ScienceDirect article explores the "Internet Fixation Effect," where using the internet to find information increases the likelihood of future internet use.  Four experiments investigated whether this effect is linked to reduced metacognitive confidence (i.e., people becoming less confident in their own memory). The experiments consistently replicated the Internet Fixation Effect, even when explicitly encouraging participants to use their memory first. However, the study found no evidence that using the internet significantly reduces metacognitive confidence. The authors suggest that the Internet Fixation Effect is likely driven by habitual reliance on the internet as a transactive memory partner, rather than diminished self-confidence in internal knowledge.

## Pseudo-specificity, pseudo-modules, and pseudo-models in paranoia

[Source](https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(25)00246-3?rss=yes)

The authors of the original piece argued that general belief updating mechanisms are more central to paranoia than specific threat detection. Razavi and colleagues disagreed with this assessment.

## Primate neuroethology: a new synthesis

[Source](https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(25)00241-4?rss=yes)

Primate neuroethology combines neuroscience with the study of natural primate behavior, using new technologies to link neural activity to real-world actions, emotions, and social interactions. By applying Tinbergen's four questions (function, mechanism, development, evolution), this approach offers deeper insights into primate cognition, with potential applications for brain-machine interfaces, neurological therapies, and both natural and artificial intelligence.
