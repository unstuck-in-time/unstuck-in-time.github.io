This is a weekly newsletter based on my RSS feeds. I have an LLM pipeline select the most relevant articles from my feeds (based on the about page of this website) and summarize them. 


## Dense longitudinal neuroimaging reveals individual brain change trajectories

[Source](https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(25)00244-X?rss=yes)

Dense longitudinal neuroimaging (DLN) is an emerging approach that samples brain structure and function frequently over short periods to precisely track individual brain change trajectories. This allows for the identification of nonlinear patterns and provides a more mechanistic understanding of cognitive development and learning, such as the motor system's role in visual development.

## OpenAI Agent Builder , Gemini revamps app , Jules API 

[Source](https://tldr.tech/ai/2025-10-06)

This TLDR AI newsletter for October 6, 2025, covers OpenAI's upcoming Agent Builder release, a potential redesign of the Gemini app, and OpenAI's acquisition of the AI-powered finance app Roi. Other highlights include potential delays for OpenAI's first device with Jony Ive, analysis of table formats for LLMs, a comparison of Nvidia's investments to the telecom bubble, and the development of AI cyber defenders. The newsletter also features engineering and research updates, including a language model fine-tuning API and a novel quantization method for LLMs. Finally, it mentions OpenAI's search for Stargate data center sites and other miscellaneous AI news.

## The age of social AI

[Source](https://sites.libsyn.com/248363/the-age-of-social-ai)

This podcast episode explores the rise of "social AI," including AI therapists, companions, and even griefbots. It features Dr. Henry Shevlin, an AI ethicist, discussing the potential societal impact of these technologies, both positive and negative, including risks to social skills and potential benefits for connection and support. The conversation touches on ethical considerations, recent tragic cases involving chatbots, and the possibility of regulation.

## Sensory reformatting for a working visual memory

[Source](https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(25)00245-1?rss=yes)

Visual working memory (WM) sustains visual representations by engaging early sensory cortex. Recent evidence suggests that these representations are not static copies of sensory input, but actively transform into task-relevant formats optimized for behavior. Visual cortex thus acts as a flexible workspace for WM, bridging perception and action.

## Teasing apart the impact of different forms of overlap on cross-linguistic structural priming

[Source](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23273798.2025.2558640?af=R)

The study investigates how different types of linguistic overlap between languages influence cross-linguistic structural priming.

## The impact of emotional face distractors on working memory performance: a meta-analysis of behavioural studies

[Source](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02699931.2025.2568559?ai=2a7&mi=3dg6fv&af=R)

A meta-analysis of behavioral studies shows that emotional faces can negatively impact working memory performance.

## Knowing what I dont know  belief in conspiracy theories relates to lower metacognitive sensitivity: a signal detection theoretic approach

[Source](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/20445911.2025.2563541?ai=2m1&mi=3dg6fv&af=R)

This study suggests a link between belief in conspiracy theories and reduced metacognitive sensitivity, meaning people who believe in conspiracy theories may be less aware of the limits of their own knowledge.

## Spiky anger, round peace: examining valence, arousal, and linguistic associations in emotion-eliciting concepts

[Source](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02699931.2025.2566304?ai=2a7&mi=3dg6fv&af=R)

This paper likely explores how words that evoke different emotions are associated with specific characteristics like valence (positive/negative), arousal (intensity), and linguistic features. The "spiky anger, round peace" suggests a contrast in these features between negative and positive emotions.

## Strategic reasoning under pressure: Testing heuristics in higher-order theory of mind

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725002720?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This ScienceDirect article, "Strategic reasoning under pressure: Testing heuristics in higher-order theory of mind," by Gregory N. Stanley, published in Cognition, explores how people make decisions in complex social situations when their cognitive resources are limited. The study tests two models: the Blind Spot Model (BM), which suggests people ignore distant possibilities, and the Near Sight Model (NM), which proposes people approximate those possibilities probabilistically. Using a new online platform called the _Morality Game_ and time-pressured sequential-choice games, the results support the NM, indicating that individuals use probabilistic heuristics rather than ignoring future states entirely when higher-order reasoning is difficult. The study also explores implications for real-world social reasoning and offers a novel methodology using diagnostic games to study theory of mind.

## More than incurious: the development of deliberate ignorance

[Source](https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(25)00254-2?rss=yes)

As children develop, they gain the cognitive abilities and experience environmental changes that make "deliberate ignorance" (choosing not to know) an increasingly viable and attractive strategy.

## Psychopathy Unmasked, The Hypocrisy Trap, and more | New books in cognitive science, neuroscience, and psychology

[Source](https://kill-the-newsletter.com/feeds/38e64wkp9h1pgiw8fsk0/entries/4oqzbxel41vkhyo15hhp.html)

This email from MIT Press advertises new and upcoming books in psychology, neuroscience, and cognitive science, including excerpts, reviews, and related features. Featured titles include works on algorithms, hypocrisy, the idealized mind, the human hand, creative intelligence, psychopathy, biological autonomy, and the unconscious. It also highlights the Open Encyclopedia of Cognitive Science.
