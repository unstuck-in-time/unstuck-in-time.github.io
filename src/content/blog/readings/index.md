## Grammatical gender in Slovak word production: an event-related potential study

[Source](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23273798.2025.2501738?af=R)

This article discusses a study investigating grammatical gender processing in Slovak word production using a picture-word interference task and EEG. The study found no significant difference in naming latencies between gender-congruent and incongruent conditions, but the EEG data revealed a P300-like effect modulated by gender congruency. This suggests that grammatical gender is always activated during Slovak speech production, even when not required for the utterance format, and that reaction time measurements may not be sensitive enough to detect this processing. The study contributes to understanding the automatic activation of lexico-syntactic features in language production and highlights potential language-specific differences in gender processing.

## Moral psychological exploration of the asymmetry effect in AI-assisted euthanasia decisions

This ScienceDirect article explores the moral psychology of AI-assisted euthanasia decisions, focusing on the "human-robot moral judgment asymmetry" where AI agents are judged more harshly than humans for similar actions. Through multiple studies, the authors investigate factors influencing this asymmetry, including the level of automation, patient autonomy, perceived competence of the AI, and explainability of its decisions. The research finds that the asymmetry effect is less pronounced when patients are conscious, the AI's competence is emphasized, and its decision-making process is transparent. A meta-analysis confirms the asymmetry's prevalence, suggesting the need for a new theory accounting for these boundary conditions in the moral psychology of robotics.

This is a description of the "Many Minds" podcast episode "Philosophers on Psychedelics," featuring Dr. Chris Letheby. The episode discusses the resurgence of interest in psychedelic drugs within philosophy, exploring their effects on ethics, epistemology, metaphysics, and the nature of the mind. It covers the history of psychedelic research, their potential for treating psychiatric conditions, and their ability to induce mystical-like experiences. The discussion also touches on moral enhancement, psychological and neural mechanisms, and various related concepts. The podcast is part of the Diverse Intelligences Summer Institute and provides links to related research, books, and social media. The site also provides an archive of past episodes from 2020-2025, categorized by month.

## 20-month-olds can use negative evidence while learning word meanings

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725001118?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This ScienceDirect article investigates whether 20-month-old infants can use negative evidence (e.g., "This is not a danu") to learn word meanings. Two experiments using eye-tracking showed that infants can use negative evidence to constrain their interpretation of a novel word, suggesting that learning word meanings may not rely solely on positive evidence. Experiment 2, contrasted to Experiment 1, showed that the no-label condition in Experiment 1 was not due to confusion but rather the interpretation of both objects being possible referents. The study challenges traditional views on lexicon acquisition and invites further research on the role of negative evidence in supporting learning.
