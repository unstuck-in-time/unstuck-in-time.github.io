## No privileged link between intentionality and causation: Generalizable effects of agency in language

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725001659?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This is a preview of a ScienceDirect article from the journal *Cognition* titled "No privileged link between intentionality and causation: Generalizable effects of agency in language." The article investigates how people's judgments of causality are influenced by the perceived agency of the actor, finding that agency affects both causal and non-causal sentences, and is linked to agentive control rather than intention. The study also concludes that the study of agency extends beyond language and reflects something more general about people's cognition. The article is authored by Sehrang Joo, Sami R. Yousif, Fabienne Martin, Frank C. Keil, and Joshua Knobe.

## Inverse option generation: Inferences about others' values based on what comes to mind

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725001787?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This ScienceDirect article, titled "Inverse option generation: Inferences about others' values based on what comes to mind", explores how people infer others' values, including moral values, by observing the options that come to their minds during decision-making. Through four studies, the authors demonstrate that people infer general values based on the options considered, the order in which they are generated, and the ease with which they come to mind. These inferences are influenced by the perceived frequency and context-specific utility of the options, and also impact moral character evaluations. The research suggests people possess an intuitive "folk theory" of option generation, which they invert to understand others' underlying values and motivations.

## Autosuggestion and mental imagery bias the perception of social emotions

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725001751?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This is a preview of an article from the journal *Cognition* on ScienceDirect. The article, titled "Autosuggestion and mental imagery bias the perception of social emotions," investigates how autosuggestion and mental imagery can modulate the perception of facial emotions, potentially for use in psychological interventions. The study uses an adaptation paradigm involving neutral faces, autosuggestion, mental imagery, and emotional words to determine if these methods can bias emotional face perception. The experiments found that both autosuggestion and mental imagery can bias perception in the direction of the desired emotion.

## Argument role sensitivity in real-time sentence processing: Evidence from a hybrid comprehension and production task

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725001957?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This ScienceDirect article preview summarizes a study investigating how argument roles (who did what to whom) are processed during real-time sentence comprehension and production. The research addresses a conflict between previous findings: comprehension studies suggest initial insensitivity to argument roles, while production studies show rapid use of this information. The authors use a hybrid comprehension-production task to demonstrate that when task demands are consistent, people show immediate use of argument roles in both comprehension and production, suggesting shared underlying mechanisms. The study explores factors like task demands and materials to explain the previously observed differences, concluding that argument roles have an immediate impact on processing in both speaking and understanding.

## Anger superiority effect or happiness superiority effect: how the distractor homogeneity modulates the asymmetry in searching emotional faces?

This is a webpage for Brain Inspired, a podcast. Episode 216 features Woodrow Shew and Keith Hengen discussing their research on brain criticality, specifically if it acts as a homeostatic "setpoint" for brain function. The page provides links to listen to the episode, subscribe to the podcast on various platforms, download the episode, read a transcript, and support the show. It also links to the researchers' labs, their published paper, and related articles on neuroscience.

## The psychology of virality

[Source](https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(25)00173-1?rss=yes)

The psychology of virality explores why some ideas spread widely while others don't, highlighting that similar psychological processes drive information sharing across online and offline contexts. These processes interact with environmental factors like norms and networks. A key paradox is that widely shared content isn't always liked. The field aims to leverage AI to better understand information spread across cultures and contexts, while also considering the limitations of the "information-as-virus" metaphor.

## Network Neuroscience: From molecules and neurons to circuits and systems

[Source](https://kill-the-newsletter.com/feeds/38e64wkp9h1pgiw8fsk0/entries/rczsbvq6igzqut1yzqhk.html)

_Network Neuroscience_ is a journal focusing on the study of brain networks across all scales. It covers empirical and computational research on topics like functional connectivity, anatomical connections, and biomolecular interactions in neurobiological systems. The latest issue includes articles on dynamic functional connectivity, functional-structural correspondence, and brain PET metabolic networks, among others. The journal supports open access and encourages data sharing.

## Does overnight memory consolidation support next-day learning?

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725001817?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This ScienceDirect article investigates whether overnight sleep consolidation supports next-day learning of hippocampus-dependent memories. Two preregistered online experiments tested memory retention of word pairs (and visuospatial memories in experiment 1) after a 12-hour delay of either sleep or wakefulness, followed by a new word-pair learning task. Results showed sleep improved memory retention compared to wakefulness, but had no significant impact on new learning. Exploratory analysis suggests a link between sleep-associated consolidation and new learning when accounting for pre-sleep retrieval performance.

## Out of sight, but still in the mind: Body-specific associations between space and valence in blind people

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725002021?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This is a preview of a ScienceDirect article titled "Out of sight, but still in the mind: Body-specific associations between space and valence in blind people" from the journal Cognition. The study investigates how visual experience influences the body-specificity effect (the association of positive concepts with the dominant side of the body) by comparing blind and sighted right-handed individuals in China. The research aims to understand if the lack of visual input and vicarious motor experiences alters the strength of space-valence associations.
