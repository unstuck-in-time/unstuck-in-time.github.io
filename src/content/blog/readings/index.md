## A question of perspective: Target- vs. perceiver-specific dimensions of mind perception

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725001714?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This ScienceDirect article explores the dimensions of mind perception, investigating why previous research has produced mixed findings. The study distinguishes between target-specific dimensions (how targets are perceived) and perceiver-specific dimensions (how perceivers differ in their perceptions). The findings suggest that target-specific dimensions align with Agency-Experience, while perceiver-specific dimensions align with Body-Heart-Mind. The research also explores how these dimensions relate to demographics, personality, and beliefs. Ultimately, the study proposes a novel unifying framework to resolve inconsistencies in mind perception research, emphasizing the importance of considering both target and perceiver perspectives.

## 'Influential Papers' Feed - 8 New Papers

This is a weekly digest from Semantic Scholar featuring papers related to "Influential Papers". The email highlights several recent publications on topics including artificial consciousness, emergent abilities in LLMs, brain-inspired AGI, evolutionary trajectories of consciousness, the social aspect of consciousness, philosophical implications of recursive AI, the derivability gap in understanding consciousness, and the relationship between psychology and AI. Each paper includes a brief TLDR summary and options to save or mark as not relevant.

## Role of contingency in the effects of appetitive and aversive motivation on emotional distraction

The effect of rewarding or punishing stimuli on emotional distraction depends on **contingency**: whether the stimuli are reliably associated with the distracting information.

## Discourse genre predicts demonstrative use in text: Experimental evidence from Dutch and Mandarin

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725002252?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This ScienceDirect article in the journal *Cognition* (December 2025) presents an experimental study in Dutch and Mandarin exploring how discourse genre (narrative vs. expository) influences writers' demonstrative use (e.g., "this" vs. "that"). The study found that discourse genre is a significant predictor of demonstrative choice, with expository texts eliciting more proximal demonstratives and narrative texts eliciting more distal demonstratives. This effect was observed even in Mandarin, which has a strong preference for proximal demonstratives. The study suggests that writers mentally position referents in relation to themselves or the reader based on the text's genre.

## BI 218 Chris Rozell: Brain Stimulation and AI for Mental Disorders

[Source](https://braininspired.co/podcast/218/)

Brain Inspired podcast episode 218 features Chris Rozell discussing his work on using brain stimulation and AI to treat mental disorders, specifically treatment-resistant depression. Rozell's research involves using brain recordings and machine learning to predict the effectiveness of deep brain stimulation in patients, aiming to personalize and improve treatment. The podcast also covers the broader intersection of neurotech and cognitive science, interdisciplinary research, and Rozell's personal background. Listeners can support the show on Patreon for full episodes and community access.
