## The psychological link between decisions and communicative behavior based on verbal probabilities

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725001702?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This ScienceDirect article preview introduces a study on the psychological link between decisions and communicative behavior related to verbal probabilities. The study proposes a Decision by Belief Sampling model, integrating the Decision by Sampling model and the reference point hypothesis, to explain how listeners infer speaker beliefs and make decisions based on those beliefs, connecting decision-making with communication strategies. The research includes four experiments examining decision-making and communication choices related to probabilistic information.

## Psychedelic Science 2025

The CogNation podcast episode "Psychedelic Science 2025" features Joe Hardy reporting from the Psychedelic Science conference in Denver. He discusses the positive but somewhat muted vibe compared to 2023, attributing it to recent negative news like the FDA's rejection of MDMA for PTSD treatment due to ethical violations and study design issues. Joe interviews Balasz Szigeti about his research on the "Placebo Suppression Effect" in psychedelic trials, where the control group improves less than expected due to participants knowing they didn't receive the psychedelic. Balasz suggests using a Zelen design to mitigate this effect. He also mentions that Compass Pathways is about to release their phase three trial data. The episode concludes by highlighting the variety of attendees at the conference, from researchers to practitioners, and encouraging listeners to subscribe and provide feedback.

## Deaf homesigners can create the foundations of phonetics and phonology without an adult linguistic model

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725001738?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This ScienceDirect article explores whether deaf children developing homesign systems can create foundations of phonetics and phonology, specifically discreteness of forms and duality of patterning. The study compares handshapes in homesigns of deaf children to co-speech gestures of their hearing mothers. The findings suggest that homesigners can introduce meaning-independent discrete forms into their communication, a resilient property of language, while handshape discreteness in mothers' co-speech gesture varied depending on the meaning.

## Decoding the temporal dynamics of numerical semantics: Early cardinal activation and the critical role of ordinal processing in spatial-numerical associations

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725001726?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This ScienceDirect article investigates the temporal dynamics of cardinal and ordinal semantics processing in spatial-numerical associations (SNAs) using a dual-choice go/nogo paradigm with ERP and MVPA techniques. Two experiments were conducted, where the parity judgment task is linked to cardinal semantics, while the memory sequence detection serves to probe ordinal semantics. The behavioral results revealed that the SNARC effect was observed only in Experiment 1, whereas the ordinal position effect emerged consistently across both experiments.  The results suggest that SNAs are primarily driven by the order of numbers constructed in working memory rather than spatial quantity. The MVPA results demonstrated that cardinal semantics are processed before ordinal semantics, with cardinal semantics decoding accuracy significantly higher than chance at 112 ms post-stimulus.

This is a navigation menu and podcast episode description for "Many Minds," a podcast exploring diverse forms of intelligence. The menu provides links to "About," "Episodes" (including categories and archives dating back to 2020), and other pages. The episode highlighted, "Varieties of Childhood," features a conversation with two researchers discussing cross-cultural differences in childhood and developmental psychology, followed by notes, links, and recommendations related to the topic. The podcast is a project of the Diverse Intelligences Summer Institute.

## Helen Steward:  Paul Snowdon on Animalism

[Source](https://philosophyofbrains.com/2025/07/10/helen-steward-paul-snowdon-on-animalism.aspx)

The Brains Blog is a leading forum since 2005 for discussions in the philosophy and science of mind, featuring articles, podcasts, a calendar of events, and calls for papers. It also has a section highlighting books and featured scholars. It also provides information about the Minds Online Conference. The blog includes archives dating back to 2005. A recent post by Helen Steward discusses Paul Snowdon's work on animalism, a theory of personal identity.

## A Fundamental Unit Of Intelligence

[Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dykkubb-Qus)

Artem Kirsanov, a neuroscience PhD student at Harvard, explores Jeff Hawkins' "Thousand Brains Theory" to explain how the brain's cortex generates intelligence. The video examines cortical columns as sensorimotor systems, their six neuronal layers, and how they build predictive models of the world through sensation, movement, and consensus voting. The video is sponsored by Brilliant, offering a free trial and discount. Further reading and references are provided for those interested in diving deeper into the science.

## Charles Jansen:  Snowdon on Personal Identity

[Source](https://philosophyofbrains.com/2025/07/09/charles-jansen-snowdon-on-personal-identity.aspx)

Philosophyofbrains.com is a blog and forum dedicated to the philosophy and science of mind, active since 2005. It features articles, a podcast, a calendar of events, and resources for contributors and scholars. The site also includes information on symposia, books, calls for papers, and a Minds Online Conference. The blog post provided discusses Charles Jansen's perspective on Paul Snowdon's arguments for animalism (the view that humans are identical to biological organisms) in the context of personal identity, concluding that while Snowdon offers strong considerations, he doesn't definitively overturn alternative views like those arising from brain transplant thought experiments.
