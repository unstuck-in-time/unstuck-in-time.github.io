## Environmental context scaffolds children's semantic representation of novel words

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725001027?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This study investigates whether environmental context influences children's semantic understanding of novel words.  Preschoolers (N=46) learned novel object-label pairs presented in either kitchen or outdoor scenes.  A subsequent verb-mediated prediction task showed that children used context-related verbs (e.g., "eat" for kitchen objects) to anticipate the target noun, indicating they integrated environmental context into their semantic representations of new words.  The data and analysis are publicly available.

## Loopholes: A window into value alignment and the communication of meaning

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001002772500071X?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This is a ScienceDirect article preview for a research paper titled "Loopholes: A window into value alignment and the communication of meaning."  The study investigates intentional misunderstandings (loopholes) in communication, exploring their prevalence, use in different relationships, and how people perceive and predict them.  Three studies�a survey and two experiments�examined loophole behavior in everyday life, its evaluation compared to compliance/non-compliance, and the influence of goal alignment and power dynamics on loophole prediction.  The findings suggest loopholes are distinct from simple disobedience, often used when goals conflict, and are perceived as less costly than outright refusal, especially when the other party holds more power.  The research has implications for understanding human communication and cooperation, and for designing safer human-machine interaction.

## Featural relations in concept learning and generalization

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725000873?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This article from *Cognition* explores featural relations in concept learning.  Three experiments demonstrate that people learn concepts based on relationships between features (e.g., an "age gap" in dating), not just individual feature values.  The findings challenge existing feature-based theories of categorization and suggest that  relational cognition plays a more significant role in human generalization than previously thought.  The study uses observational and classification learning paradigms with undergraduate students as participants.

## Divide (evenly) and conquer (quickly): Spatial exploration behaviors predict navigational learning and differ by sex

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725000848?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This study investigated the relationship between exploration behaviors and spatial navigation performance in 100 young adults using a virtual maze task.  Even exploration (consistent visits to all areas) and quickly finding objects were strongly correlated with better accuracy and efficiency in navigating the maze.  While video game experience and perspective-taking abilities also predicted performance, a mediation analysis revealed that even exploration, more so than video game experience, explained sex differences in navigational accuracy.  The study concludes that exploration quality, not quantity, is crucial for successful spatial learning, and that individual differences in navigational ability are largely intrinsic rather than solely dependent on the exploration path itself.

## Observed reaching speed signals stimulus value and informs foraging

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725000885?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This study investigates how observed reaching speed influences foraging behavior.  Four experiments using a touchscreen "tree-shaking" game showed that: 1) Reaching speed correlates with stimulus value (faster for higher-value stimuli); 2) Observers infer stimulus value from observed reaching speed; 3) Observed reaching speed influences observers' desire to forage the stimulus; and 4) Observed reaching speed affects observers' foraging time and effort, with faster observed reaches leading to longer foraging times.  The findings highlight the role of action understanding and social learning in optimal foraging, suggesting that observers use subtle movement cues to infer value and guide their own behavior.

## The specificity of sequential statistical learning: Statistical learning accumulates predictive information from unstructured input but is dissociable from (declarative) memory for words

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725000708?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This article investigates the role of statistical learning in word segmentation, challenging the common belief that it directly leads to word memorization.  Through computational modeling and two experiments, the authors demonstrate that while adults can track statistical regularities (transitional probabilities) in continuous speech, this ability is dissociable from declarative memory for words.  They found that participants primarily learned statistical structures in continuous, not pre-segmented, speech, suggesting statistical learning's primary function may be predictive processing rather than explicit word storage.  The study highlights the importance of other cues, such as prosodic boundaries, in word learning.

## Common and distinct neural substrates of rule- and similarity-based category learning

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725000836?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

This study investigated the neural substrates of rule-based and similarity-based category learning using EEG-fNIRS.  Three experiments, manipulating instruction type (explicit vs. self-discovery) and rule complexity, revealed distinct neural processes for each strategy. Rule-based learning showed greater P300 and N400 ERP components and Wernicke's area activation, suggesting reliance on an explicit system. Similarity-based learning exhibited larger P1 components and frontopolar cortex activation, indicating an implicit system. These findings support the COVIS theory of multiple learning systems and challenge single-system accounts of category learning.

## Semantic extension in a novel communication system is facilitated by salient shared associations

[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725000691?dgcid=rss_sd_all)

Two experiments investigated how novel labels are semantically extended in a controlled communication system.  Results show that salient, shared associations (e.g., between colors and shapes) facilitate initial semantic extension and subsequent chaining of extensions.  Extensions based on less certain associations (e.g., colors and emotions) showed greater variability. This method allows for controlled testing of semantic extension processes, offering experimental evidence on the association-extension relationship.  Data and code are available in an OSF repository.

## The transposed-word effect under serial presentation revisited: a replication study and meta-analysis

[Source](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23273798.2025.2496910?af=R)

This is a research article published in *Language, Cognition and Neuroscience* reporting on a replication study and meta-analysis of the transposed-word effect under serial presentation.  The study found a significant transposed-word effect in error rates but not in response times, although the meta-analysis indicated a small, significant effect in response times overall.  Data and analysis scripts are available on the Open Science Framework.
